As O
evidenced O
during O
prior O
polysomnographic O
evaluations O

mostly O
of O
obstructive O

The O
patient O
appears O
largely O

as O
he O

the O
Mallinckrodt O

2 O

with O
difficulty O
in O
sleep O
reinitiation O

thereby O
compounding O
his O

While O
there O
would O
logically O
be O
a O
relationship O
between O
his O
current O

exacerbations O
and O
the O
recent O
death O
of O
his O
wife O
from O
pancreatic O
cancer O

there O
may O
also O
be O

PLAN O



1 O

In O
the O
short O
course O

in O
so O
far O
as O
the O
patient O
describes O
himself O
as O
being O
exceedingly O
tired O

and O
unable O
to O
perform O
the O
routine O
daily O
tasks O
of O
work O
and O
managing O
a O
family O
in O
the O
absence O
of O
his O
deceased O
wife O

I O
have O
suggested O
initiation O
of O
PRN O
Zolpidem O
tartrate O
therapy O

5 O
mg O
tablets O

utilizing O
one O
to O
two O
tablets O
p O

q O

h O
s O

PRN O
for O
difficulties O
of O
sleep O
reinitiation O
and O
maintenance O



2 O

The O
patient O
is O
advised O
to O
take O
Zolpidem O
tartrate O
therapy O
no O
more O
than O
2 O
3 O
times O
per O
week O

in O
an O
effort O
to O
avoid O
any O
issues O
of O
physiologic O
dependency O



3 O

The O
patient O
was O
advised O
against O
potential O
adverse O
behavioral O
and O
or O
systemic O
side O
effects O
of O
Zolpidem O
tartrate O
therapy O
including O

hypersomnolence O

gastric O
upset O

loose O
stools O

diarrhea O

and O
or O
cardiac O
palpitations O



Pending O
his O
clinical O
response O
of O
his O
Zolpidem O
tartrate O
therapy O

I O
then O
might O
seek O
direct O
treatment O
for O
his O
sleep O
disordered O
breathing O
issues O
which O
may O
include O
a O
repeat O
sleep O
study O
with O
potential O
trial O
of O
BIPAP O
therapy O

in O
an O
effort O
to O
modify O
or O
attenuate O
claustrophobic O
symptoms O


If O
he O
proves O
poorly O
responsive O
to O
trial O
of O
BIPAP O
therapy O
however O

I O
might O
consider O
supplemental O
O2 O
therapy O
at O
night O
and O

with O
this O
in O
mind O
a O
follow O
up O
sleep O
study O
should O
have O
associated O
end O
tidal O
CO2 O
monitoring O

well O

In O
the O
meantime O

the O
patient O
was O
advised O
to O
contact O
the O
sleep O
disorders O
clinic O
for O
any O
acute O
sleep O
related O
concerns O
in O
the O
interim O



5 O

The O
patient O
may O
also O
benefit O
from O
nonpharmacologic O
approaches O
with O
regards O
to O
sleep O
reinitiation O
such O
as O
hypnotherapy O

her O

better O

Ms O

The O

As O

I O

She O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN O


In O
summary O

we O
have O
a O
63 AGE
year O
old O
diabetic O
man O
who O
appears O
to O
have O
significant O
sensorimotor O
polyneuropathy O
with O
autonomic O
involvement O


He O
does O
have O
constipation O
and O
impotence O
as O
well O
as O
orthostatic O
hypotension O






As O
we O
discussed O
on O
the O
phone O

his O
antihypertensive O
medications O
need O
to O
be O
adjusted O
and O
the O
patient O
will O
be O
following O
up O
with O
you O
regarding O
this O


He O
may O
benefit O
from O
Jobst O
stockings O
to O
reduce O
his O
symptoms O
of O
orthostatic O
hypotension O


I O
will O
be O
ordering O
an O
EMG O
to O
assess O
his O
polyneuropathy O
and O
look O
for O
any O
evidence O
of O
superimposed O
ulnar O
neuropathy O
or O
cervical O
radiculopathy O
on O
the O
left O


The O
EMG O
should O
also O
include O
RR O
interval O
variations O
and O
sympathetic O
skin O
responses O







MRI O
of O
the O
cervical O
spine O
was O
also O
ordered O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
cord O
compression O
which O
may O
also O
contribute O
to O
loss O
of O
sensation O
in O
the O
legs O


The O
patient O
does O
have O
a O
history O
of O
traumatic O
cervical O
herniated O
disk O
in O
2125 DATE


He O
may O
also O
have O
had O
a O
left O
elbow O
injury O
at O
this O
time O
which O
can O
make O
him O
prone O
to O
develop O
tardy O
ulnar O
palsy O







The O
patient O
will O
return O
for O
a O
follow O
up O
visit O
after O
the O
above O

Dear O

I O
saw O
your O

Kenneth PATIENT
Umstead PATIENT

in O
the O
Cardiology O
office O
today O
and O
he O
seems O
to O
be O
doing O
very O
well O
from O
a O
cardiovascular O
perspective O


Apparently O
he O
has O
had O
guaiac O
positive O
stools O
and O
has O
undergone O
a O
colonoscopy O
with O
the O
identification O
of O
four O
polyps O


Three O
have O
been O
removed O
and O
he O
then O
had O
a O
GI O
bleed O


This O
has O
been O
reevaluated O
and O
he O
has O
been O
stable O


The O
fourth O
polyp O
will O
need O
to O
be O
removed O
at O
a O
later O
time O


At O
this O
point O

his O
aspirin O
has O
been O
discontinued O
for O
a O
number O
of O
days O
and O
the O
Lopid O
was O
also O
discontinued O
apparently O
because O
of O
increased O
liver O
function O
tests O


His O
current O
medications O
therefore O
include O
Lasix O
40 O
mg O
per O
day O

Metoprolol O
25 O
mg O
qd O

Nifedipine O
XL O
30 O
mg O

He O
is O
aware O
of O
a O
belching O
and O
burping O
sensation O
after O
eating O
but O
otherwise O
no O
exertional O
or O
other O
related O
symptoms O


He O
is O
reasonably O
active O
but O
somewhat O
limited O
by O
his O
claudication O



On O
exam O
today O

he O
is O
comfortable O
with O
a O
blood O
pressure O
of O
130 O
70 O

a O
heart O
rate O
of O
65 O
and O
regular O


Head O
and O
neck O
were O
unremarkable O


Chest O
is O
clear O


Cardiac O
exam O
showed O
no O
jugular O
venous O
distension O
at O
30 O
degrees O


PMI O
is O
normal O


S1 O
and O
S2 O
are O
normal O
with O
a O
physiologic O

There O
is O
an O
S4 O

the O
left O
sternal O
border O

I O

Mr O

is O
basically O
doing O
quite O
well O


It O
would O
be O
of O
value O
to O
repeat O
an O
exercise O
test O
since O
he O
has O
not O
had O
one O
since O
2069 DATE


He O
had O
minimal O
ischemia O
at O
that O
time O


There O
are O
no O
symptoms O
that O
would O
prompt O
cardiac O
catheterization O
at O
this O
point O
and O
we O
will O
see O
how O
he O
does O
on O
the O
exercise O
test O
with O
the O
objective O
findings O






If O
any O
problems O
develop O

please O
don O

you O
very O
much O

tolerate O
it O
twice O
a O

he O
will O
have O
a O

prevention O

I O
suggest O
that O
we O
increase O
it O
to O
50 O
mg O
bid O

I O
also O
told O
him O
how O
to O
take O
his O
pulse O
and O
he O
can O
keep O
an O
eye O
on O
it O

If O
it O
drops O
too O
low O
we O
can O
reduce O
the O
dose O

He O
asked O
that O
I O
see O
him O
again O
in O
about O
six O
months O
for O
routine O
re O

and O
I O
will O
be O

If O
any O

develop O
in O
the O

please O
do O

Dear O

I O

your O
patient O
Kenneth PATIENT
Umstead PATIENT
in O
the O
Cardiology O
Office O
today O
and O
he O
feels O
he O
has O
actually O
improved O


His O
primary O
limitation O
had O
been O
his O
claudication O

but O
he O
feels O
that O
he O
can O
walk O
better O
now O
than O
in O
the O
past O


We O
had O
a O
repeat O
evaluation O
of O
his O
segmental O
leg O
pressure O
and O
volumes O

and O
these O
actually O
were O
unchanged O
from O
a O
prior O
study O
two O
years O
ago O


The O
post O
volume O
recordings O
were O
normal O
in O
each O
leg O


Systolic O
pressure O
gradients O
were O
present O
in O
the O
right O
leg O
consistent O
with O
mild O
anterior O

No O

were O

in O
the O

These O
were O
unchanged O
from O

he O

on O

Mr O

Ocampo PATIENT
is O
making O
a O
slow O

study O
recovery O
from O
his O
multivessel O
coronary O
bypass O
graft O
surgery O


I O
suggested O
he O
undergo O
repeat O
echocardiogram O
to O
document O
current O
left O
ventricular O
function O
now O
that O
he O
is O
back O
in O

I O
told O
him O
he O
would O
stay O
on O
amiodarone O
for O
approximately O
3 O
6 O
months O

and O
assuming O

he O
was O
in O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
throughout O
this O
time O
period O

his O
amiodarone O
would O
then O
be O
discontinued O


At O
that O
time O

I O
would O
also O
discontinue O
his O
Coumadin O


In O
addition O

at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
diagnostic O
catheterization O

he O
had O
evidence O
for O
severe O
peripheral O
vascular O
disease O

and O
he O
understands O
that O
when O
he O
has O
completed O
his O
recovery O
from O
his O
recent O
surgery O

I O
would O
strongly O
encourage O
further O
evaluation O
of O
his O
lower O
extremity O
arterial O
system O
with O
an O
eye O
toward O
potential O
percutaneous O
intervention O


In O
addition O

I O
have O
asked O
him O
to O
obtain O
copies O
of O
his O
discharge O
summary O
from O
the O
Gadsden HOSPITAL
Medical HOSPITAL
Center HOSPITAL


I O
would O
like O
to O
resume O
ACE O
inhibitor O
therapy O
in O
light O
of O
his O
significant O
CAD O
and O
probable O
left O
ventricular O
dysfunction O


He O
will O
have O
routine O
blood O
studies O
obtained O
today O


I O
would O
target O
his O
LDL O
cholesterol O
to O
the O
70 O
range O


Beyond O
this O

I O
have O
not O
altered O
his O
current O
regimen O


Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
assist O
in O

the O

a O
half O

during O

14 O

the O

the O

He O

he O
required O

that O






It O
has O

At O

his O

in O
the O

which O
mainly O
occurs O
with O


activity O
but O
he O
also O
has O
rest O

He O

a O

he O
has O

his O
left O

which O
consist O
of O
high O

a O

knee O
replacement O

feels O
that O

We O

reconsider O


should O
he O

in O
the O
next O

aspirating O
his O

instilling O

We O
have O
advised O
him O
that O
this O
will O
only O


provide O
him O
with O
short O

may O
allow O
him O
enough O
relief O
to O
begin O


some O

in O
an O

We O

6 O

We O
will O
obtain O
an O

have O
a O
better O
idea O

In O
addition O

I O
strongly O
encouraged O
him O
to O
lose O
as O
much O
weight O
as O
possible O


He O
seems O
both O
very O
interested O
in O
losing O
weight O
but O
at O
the O

time O
somewhat O
cavalier O
an O
overly O
confident O
that O
he O
will O
be O
able O
to O
do O
so O


I O
think O
the O
most O
important O
thing O
is O
going O
to O
be O
dietary O
management O

since O
I O
doubt O
he O
will O
ever O
be O
able O
to O
do O
enough O
physical O
activity O
to O
burn O
sufficient O
calories O
to O
lose O
weight O
on O
that O
basis O
alone O


We O
will O
check O
his O
Chem O
25 O
today O
as O
well O
as O
CRP O

and O
I O
will O
review O
these O
results O
with O
him O
as O
soon O
as O
they O
are O
available O

I O
also O
asked O
him O
to O
check O
on O
his O
blood O
pressure O
at O
home O
and O
let O
me O
know O
the O
results O

If O
any O
problems O
develop O
in O
the O

please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
contact O
me O


We O
will O
hopefully O
be O
able O
to O
identify O
his O
preop O

factor O
status O
with O
his O

complaint O
of O
acute O
onset O
shortness O
of O
breath O

He O
was O
in O
his O
usual O
state O
of O
health O
when O
one O
week O
PTA O
he O
decided O
to O
abruptly O
discontinue O
his O
Fentanyl O
patch O

which O
he O
had O
for O
three O
years O
at O
75mg O
for O
pain O
associated O
with O
peripheral O
neuropathy O
and O
gastroparesis O

He O
recently O
decided O
he O
no O
longer O
wanted O
to O
wear O
the O
patch O
because O
he O
was O
concerned O
about O
personality O
changes O
and O
side O
effects O
of O
the O
medication O

His O
PCP O
instructed O
him O
to O
taper O
the O
medication O

switching O
him O
to O
a O
50 O
mg O
patch O

but O
Mr O

Kaufman PATIENT
removed O
the O
patch O
without O
a O

he O
experienced O
the O
acute O
onset O
of O
shortness O
of O
breath O
and O
chest O
tightness O

He O
described O
the O
chest O
tightness O
as O

with O
a O

chest O

intermittent O

non O
radiating O
and O
somewhat O
relieved O
by O
moving O
his O
R O
shoulder O


This O
pain O
lasted O
4 O
5 O
minutes O
but O
his O
shortness O
of O
breath O
persisted O

The O
shortness O
of O
breath O
was O
worse O
with O
exertion O

not O
improved O
with O

and O
caused O
his O
to O
take O
rapid O
shallow O
breaths O

He O
also O
began O
to O
have O
a O
non O

cough O
this O

Patricia PATIENT
is O
a O
70 AGE
year O
old O
retired O
woman O

right O
hand O
dominant O

who O
comes O
with O
complaints O
of O
soreness O
in O
her O
right O
wrist O


She O
apparently O
had O
a O
fall O

which O
caused O
substantial O
pain O
and O
some O
swelling O

but O
no O
bruising O


Brought O
her O
in O
to O
have O
an O
evaluation O


X O
rays O
showed O
no O
fracture O
and O
over O
the O
last O
few O
weeks O
things O
have O
improved O
substantially O

and O
she O
comes O
in O
just O
because O
she O
was O
told O
to O
get O
it O
checked O
out O
by O
her O
doctors O

but O
otherwise O
feeling O
quite O
good O
and O
wondering O
if O
the O
appointment O
is O
even O
necessary O







Past O
medical O
history O
includes O
high O
blood O
pressure O
and O
diabetes O







No O
prior O
surgeries O







No O
medications O







No O
known O
drug O
allergies O







Lists O
no O
family O
history O
of O
any O
problems O







Lives O
alone O
and O
used O
to O
smoke O

but O
quit O







On O
examination O

she O
has O
full O
range O
of O
motion O
of O
her O
wrist O
compared O
to O
the O
opposite O
side O


No O
atrophy O

ecchymosis O

edema O
or O
deformity O


Negative O
scaphoid O
shift O
test O


Slight O
tenderness O
over O
the O
distal O
radius O


Normal O
tendon O
function O







My O
impression O
is O
that O
she O
must O
have O
got O
a O
mild O
sprain O

which O
has O
recovered O
or O
possibly O
even O
a O
nondisplaced O
fracture O
given O
her O
age O
and O
osteoporotic O
bone O

but O
whatever O
this O
was O

it O
has O
resolved O
almost O
entirely O

she O
is O
functioning O
well O

and O
there O
is O
no O
apparent O
problem O

so O
I O
will O
see O
her O
back O
as O
needed O

over O

past O
2 O
weeks O


When O
I O
saw O
her O
a O
few O
weeks O
ago O

she O
was O
very O
dehydrated O
and O
required O
a O
decrease O
in O
dose O
of O
her O
Lasix O
due O
to O
symptoms O
of O
dehydration O
as O
well O
as O
a O
rise O
in O
her O

She O
responded O
well O
to O
this O
and O
then O
did O
well O
for O
a O
week O
or O
so O


Then O
she O
saw O
Dr O

Vuong DOCTOR
who O
increased O
her O
dose O
of O
Lasix O
back O
to O

Subsequently O

she O
developed O

which O

at O

is O
up O

has O
been O
very O

has O
had O
a O

over O

She O

followed O

Reviewing O

she O
does O

also O
her O

I O
believe O
the O

may O

to O
the O
Norvasc O


Therefore O

I O
advised O
her O
to O
stop O

she O

it O
may O

Will O
consider O
increasing O
her O
Lasix O
based O
on O
how O
she O
responds O
to O
discontinuing O
the O

Mr O

is O
a O
52 AGE

old O
male O
with O
paroxysmal O

We O
have O
discussed O
the O
physiology O
of O
the O
electrical O

the O
pathophysiology O
of O
atrial O

We O
have O
discussed O

We O
have O
scheduled O
him O

given O
his O
symptoms O
of O

of O
atrial O
fibrillation O
and O
will O
send O
him O
for O

to O
R O
O O
structural O
heart O
disease O



We O
have O
had O
a O
long O
discussion O
regarding O
Cryo O
Ablation O
and O
if O
his O
diagnostic O
testing O
is O
within O
normal O
limits O
he O
would O
like O
to O
possibly O
consider O
this O
as O
an O
option O
for O
treatment O

We O
have O
started O
him O
on O
Toprol O
XL O
50 O

If O
his O

is O
within O

we O
will O
proceed O
initially O
with O
starting O
Class O
IC O
antiarrhythmic O
for O
the O
treatment O
of O
his O
atrial O
fibrillation O

We O
will O
continue O
a O
discussion O
regarding O
Cryo O
Ablation O
and O
continue O
medical O
management O

He O
has O
a O
CHAD2 O
Score O
of O
0 O

We O
will O
therefore O
recommend O
treating O
with O
Aspirin O
325 O
mg O
daily O
for O
prophylactic O
embolic O
protection O
and O
would O
not O
recommend O
coumadin O

The O

Yonathan DOCTOR

of O
general O

The O
patient O
had O
expressed O
an O
interest O
in O
considering O





colectomy O
after O
initially O
refusing O
colectomy O
since O
January DATE
2095 DATE






Initially O

this O
was O
due O
to O
concerns O
about O
possible O
transfusion O
needs O
during O





surgery O


After O
extensive O





conversations O
with O
Dr O

Orth DOCTOR
and O
with O
her O
family O

and O
with O
the O
patient O






I O
believe O
that O
the O
comorbidities O
associated O
with O
the O
surgery O
and O





perioperative O
healing O

far O
outweigh O
any O
potential O
benefits O
that O
she O
may O





have O
from O
this O
potential O
surgery O
and O
therefore O
we O
collectively O
decided O
not O





to O
pursue O
this O












Chest O

The O

had O
no O
evidence O
of O

by O

Adenosine O

did O
not O

any O

defects O


She O
will O





continue O
to O
be O
treated O
with O
antihypertensives O


Her O
chest O
wall O
pain O
is O





likely O
due O
to O
esophageal O
spasm O












Gastrointestinal O

Her O
esophageal O
spasms O
and O
GERD O
will O
be O
treated O
with O
PPI O












Chronic O
pain O
syndrome O

She O
has O
chronic O
pain O
from O
osteoarthritis O
and O





fibromyalgia O


This O
has O
led O
to O
debilitating O
weakness O
in O
upper O
or O
lower O





extremities O
and O
reliance O
upon O
chronic O
pain O
medications O

At O
the O
time O

we O





will O
continue O
pain O
medications O
for O
her O
comfort O


Continue O
aggressive O

Feeding O

The O
patient O
needs O
a O

Overall O

these O
were O
stable O

and O
the O

quite O
suggestive O
of O
pulmonary O

However O

as O
I O
reviewed O
with O
the O
patient O
and O
his O
wife O

it O
is O
well O
established O
that O
10 O

of O
the O
time O

another O
disorder O

such O
as O
occult O
hypersensitivity O
pneumonitis O
or O
nonspecific O
interstitial O
pneumonitis O
can O
be O
found O
on O
lung O
biopsy O


There O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
a O
rheumatologic O
disorder O
nor O
any O
evidence O
of O
chronic O
aspiration O

other O
than O
that O
associated O
with O
GE O
reflux O

to O
explain O
his O
lung O
disease O


He O
would O
be O
a O
very O
reasonable O
candidate O
for O
gamma O
interferon O

although O
this O
likely O
would O
necessitate O
low O
dose O
steroids O


the O
latter O
treatment O
would O
certainly O
have O
an O
impact O
on O
his O
diabetes O




2 O

GE O
reflux O


This O
is O
the O
main O
source O
of O
his O
cough O
and O
is O
well O
established O
to O
be O
associated O
with O
pulmonary O
fibrosis O


If O
he O
is O
able O
to O
lose O
weight O
and O
change O
his O
lifestyle O

he O
can O
have O
very O
good O
control O

7 O

Obesity O


He O
continues O
to O
need O

As O
I O

he O

not O

Impression O




1 O

Biopsy O
proven O
idiopathic O
pulmonary O
fibrosis O


The O
biopsy O
reading O
is O
somewhat O
unusual O

and O
I O
will O
review O
this O
at O
our O
Pulmonary O
group O
weekly O
meeting O

particularly O
with O
an O
eye O
to O
agents O
that O
might O
possibly O
target O
to O
exclude O
muscle O
metaplasia O


I O
continue O
to O
think O
him O
a O
relatively O
high O
risk O
candidate O
for O
the O
low O
benefit O
regiment O
of O
prednisone O

with O
an O
immunosuppressant O
agent O


I O
think O
he O
may O
be O
a O
very O
good O
candidate O
for O
gamma O
interferon O

but O
unfortunately O
not O
every O
one O
benefits O
from O
this O






I O
emphasized O
strongly O
to O
he O
and O
his O
wife O
that O
his O
disease O
may O
have O
progressed O

or O
could O
be O
made O
worse O
by O
the O
recent O
chest O
surgery O
and O
worsened O
gastroesophageal O
reflux O


If O
the O
disease O
was O

indeed O

progressing O

we O
would O
need O
to O
proceed O
with O
lung O
transplantation O
workup O


The O
most O
significant O
contraindication O
currently O
to O
transplantation O
is O
his O
substantial O
obesity O


I O
calculated O
with O
him O
that O
he O
needed O
to O
have O
his O
weight O
down O
to O
190 O
lbs O

to O
get O
to O
a O
BMI O
of O
30 O

and O
that O
by O
the O
time O
of O
listing O
he O
needed O
to O
have O
a O
BMI O
of O
approximately O
32 O


Hence O

he O
has O
his O
work O
cut O
out O
for O
him O




2 O

Obesity O


As O
above O




3 O

Diabetes O




4 O

Possible O
coronary O
artery O
disease O


He O
apparently O
did O
fine O
on O
his O
preoperative O
cardiac O
workup O




5 O

GE O
reflux O


As O
mentioned O




6 O

Cough O


Mainly O
due O
to O
GE O
reflux O

and O
less O
prominent O
contribution O
from O
the O
pulmonary O
fibrosis O

I O
expect O
that O

Patient O
comes O
in O

today O
for O
a O
routine O
follow O
up O

her O
blood O

as O
well O
as O

On O
her O

her O
blood O
pressure O
was O
160 O
90 O


and O
on O
check O
today O
it O
was O
150 O
90 O


We O
discussed O
the O
possibility O
that O
she O

continue O
her O
salt O
restricted O
diet O


We O
also O
discussed O
that O
she O
continue O

her O
own O
exercise O

both O
of O
which O
she O
does O
faithfully O

and O
we O
also O
discussed O

the O

As O
far O
as O
long O

my O
current O

is O
to O
evaluate O
her O

pressure O
on O
another O

visit O
in O
the O
next O
6 O
8 O
weeks O
and O
at O
that O

time O
if O
it O
is O
elevated O

we O
will O
consider O
either O
going O
up O
on O
her O
nifedipine O

going O
up O
on O

if O
we O
can O
possibly O

gain O
some O
better O
control O

possibly O
adding O

agent O


However O

at O

this O
point O
she O
seems O
to O
be O
doing O
much O
better O
with O
this O
new O
blood O
pressure O

and O
this O
is O
significant O
improvement O

from O
her O
previous O

pressure O
on O
her O
first O
admission O

which O
was O
systolic O
blood O
pressures O

the O

200s O
190s O





Her O
family O
situation O
which O
was O
somewhat O
unstable O
at O
her O
first O
presentation O

now O
appears O
to O
be O
much O
more O
stable O


She O
is O
currently O
living O
with O

she O
says O
that O
she O
she O
is O

HPI O

Mrs O

William PATIENT
Nuel PATIENT
is O
a O
61 AGE
year O
old O
patient O
of O
mine O
who O
carries O
a O

diagnosis O
of O
essential O
hypertension O
and O
comes O
in O
today O
for O
a O
routine O

checkup O

Patient O
appears O
to O
be O
doing O
fine O

She O
has O
been O
compliant O
with O
her O

antihypertensive O
regimen O

which O
consists O
of O
nifedipine O
and O
also O

hydrochlorothiazide O

Since O
our O
last O
meeting O

the O
patient O
has O
lost O

approximately O
15 O
to O
20 O
pounds O

She O
has O
been O
exercising O
on O
a O
daily O
basis O

and O
eating O
very O
well O

both O
of O
which O
have O
had O
very O

very O
significant O
and O

beneficial O
results O
on O
her O
blood O
pressure O
and O
pressure O
today O
on O
examination O

was O
120 O
80 O
in O
both O
arms O

The O
patient O
was O
complaining O
of O
some O
ankle O

swelling O

and O
in O
looking O
through O
her O
medicines O
I O
noted O
that O
she O
had O
been O

on O
furosemide O

which O
was O
a O
holdover O
from O
the O
time O
of O
her O
most O
recent O

admission O

I O
quickly O
switched O
to O
furosemide O
to O
hydrochlorothiazide O

which O

I O
feel O
would O
give O
her O
much O
better O
diuretic O
response O
and O
relief O
of O
her O

symptoms O
over O
the O
next O
few O
days O




The O
final O
issue O
with O
the O
patient O
today O
is O
low O
back O
pain O

which O
she O
has O
had O

chronically O
for O
the O
last O
several O
years O
after O
suffering O
a O
fall O
in O
2065 DATE

We O

have O
tried O
a O
whole O
host O
of O
conservative O
measures O

which O
have O
included O
bed O

rest O

nonsteroidal O
anti O
inflammatory O
agents O

and O
back O
exercises O

The O

patient O
is O
referred O
now O
to O
the O
Paoli HOSPITAL
Memorial HOSPITAL
Hospital HOSPITAL
Spinal O
Clinic O
for O

services O
to O
obtain O
further O
help O

and O
hopefully O
treatment O

of O
her O
pain O


Treatment O
recommendations O
from O
the O
Spinal O
Clinic O
will O
be O
forthcoming O


Patient O
is O
scheduled O
to O
follow O
up O
with O
me O
again O
in O
two O
to O
three O
months O



ADDENDUM O

The O
issue O
of O
her O
annual O
screening O
was O
addressed O
also O
and O
patient O

agreed O
to O
have O
her O
cholesterol O
checked O
today O

but O
does O
not O
want O
to O
have O

either O
a O
mammogram O
or O
a O
Pap O
smear O

She O
complains O
that O
she O
does O
not O
have O

faith O
in O
these O
procedures O
and O
that O
this O
is O
something O
that O
she O
is O
not O
used O

to O
and O
does O
not O
want O
to O
have O
done O

I O
attempted O
to O
discuss O
the O
need O
and O
why O

it O
is O
necessary O
to O
undergo O
continued O
screening O
and O
will O
continue O
to O
do O

this O
with O
the O
patient O
in O
the O
future O

but O
for O
now O

the O
patient O
adamantly O

refuses O
either O
of O
the O
two O
examinations O

who O

search O
of O
a O
second O
opinion O
about O
his O
care O
at O
the O
Boaz HOSPITAL
Nursing HOSPITAL
Home HOSPITAL
in O
Lynden CITY

He O
has O
a O
hx O
of O
prostate O

diagnosed O
in O
2059 DATE
at O
the O
BNH HOSPITAL
and O
had O
an O
RRP O
shortly O
thereafter O
at O
the O
BNH HOSPITAL

Apparently O
his O
pathology O
showed O
extraprostatic O
extension O
and O
he O
received O
postop O
XRT O

Apparently O

he O
has O
remained O
disease O
free O
since O
this O
time O
until O
a O
PSA O
was O
checked O
this O
past O
October DATE
which O
was O
3 O

He O
states O
that O
he O
had O
not O
had O
his O
PSA O
checked O
for O
a O
few O
years O
before O
this O

admittedly O
perhaps O
because O
he O
had O
missed O
appointments O

The O
Urologists O
at O
the O
BNH HOSPITAL
have O
since O
checked O
a O
bone O
scan O
and O
abdominal O
CT O
scan O

all O
of O
which O
were O
negative O

He O
has O
the O
reports O
here O
with O
him O

The O
bone O
scan O
does O
show O
an O
abnormality O
at O

but O
with O
data O
from O

this O
appears O

not O

He O
also O
has O
had O
recurrent O
problems O
with O
bleeding O
from O
hemorrhagic O
radiation O
cystitis O

This O
occurs O
once O
every O
few O
months O
or O
so O
and O
is O
not O
currently O
bothering O
him O

He O
states O
that O
he O
is O
scheduled O
to O
have O
a O
cystoscopy O
at O
the O
BNH HOSPITAL
next O
week O

however O

is O
unsure O
if O
he O
has O
had O
a O
urine O

done O






Impression O

In O
reviewing O
the O
patient O
s O
limited O
records O
that O
he O
brings O
and O
his O
history O

it O
appears O
that O
he O
has O
had O
the O
appropriate O
care O
at O
the O
BNH HOSPITAL

I O
have O
reassured O
him O
of O
this O

and O
have O
indicated O
that O
he O
should O
just O
make O
sure O
that O
a O
urine O

is O
also O
checked O
and O
that O
a O
repeat O

also O

Ms O

Stephenson PATIENT
comes O
in O
for O
discussion O
of O
her O
stress O
test O
last O
week O

which O

was O
positive O


She O
went O
9 O
minutes O
and O
11 O
seconds O
on O
a O
modified O
Bruce O
to O

a O
maximum O
heart O
rate O
of O
131 O

which O
was O
81 O

of O
predicted O


She O
had O
1mm O

and O
2mm O
ST O
depressions O

which O
was O
predictive O
of O
significant O
coronary O

disease O


She O
continues O
to O
have O
chest O
pain O
only O
when O
she O
is O
exercising O

vigorously O

which O
is O
rapidly O
walking O


She O
vehemently O
denies O
that O
she O

has O
any O
chest O
pain O
at O
rest O
or O
with O
less O
exertion O



We O
began O
a O
discussion O
of O
what O
kind O
of O
intervention O
she O
might O
like O
to O

have O

and O
we O
will O
continue O
this O
over O
time O

but O
currently O
she O
is O
not O

interested O
in O
intervention O
if O
we O
can O
manage O
her O
medically O



PLAN O


I O
will O
start O
her O
today O
on O
atenolol O
25mg O
and O
on O
an O
aspirin O


She O

refused O
nitroglycerine O
because O
she O
did O
not O
feel O
that O
she O
had O
any O
need O

for O
taking O
it O


She O
will O
come O
back O
in O
one O
week O
to O
see O
how O
her O
pulse O
is O

on O
atenolol O





Today O
blood O
pressure O
was O
164 O
82 O
and O
her O
pulse O
was O
80 O





We O
will O
increase O
the O
atenolol O
as O
tolerated O


I O
will O
continue O
to O
work O

with O
her O
strenuously O
on O
risk O
factor O
modification O


Her O
other O
risk O

factors O
include O
diabetes O

hypertension O

and O
hypercholesterolemia O

though O

her O
cholesterol O
is O
current O
well O
controlled O
with O
an O
LDL O
of O
95 O


Her O

diabetes O
is O
not O
as O
well O
controlled O

and O
I O
think O
I O
will O
consider O
sending O

her O
to O
Olivia DOCTOR
Orosco DOCTOR
for O
further O
management O
of O
this O



She O
will O
return O
to O

me O
in O
a O
week O
s O
time O

and O
she O
understands O
that O
hip O

if O
she O
has O

that O
she O

then O
she O

for O
it O
and O
eats O
it O






then O


She O

I O
hope O
that O
she O
will O






help O
her O
with O
her O
diet O


If O
her O
diet O
does O
get O
better O

maybe O
we O
can O






wean O
her O
off O
the O
insulin O
and O
try O
Micronase O


I O
explained O
to O
her O

too O







that O
if O
she O
both O
had O
a O
good O
diet O
and O
lost O
some O
weight O
that O
we O
might O






be O
able O
to O
get O
her O
off O
the O
insulin O


This O
seemed O
to O
be O
something O
that O






she O
would O
like O
to O
do O


Hopefully O
the O
nutritionist O
can O
help O


I O
also O






told O
her O
that O
in O
order O
to O
find O
out O
what O
was O
going O
on O
that O
I O
need O
her O






to O
take O
her O
blood O
sugar O
before O
breakfast O

lunch O

dinner O
and O
sleep O







and O
then O
come O
back O
in O
a O
week O
and O
a O
half O
so O
that O
we O
can O
see O
what O
was O






really O
going O
on O
and O
whether O
they O
are O
getting O
too O
low O


She O
denies O
any O






kind O
of O
symptoms O
with O
even O
as O
low O
a O
blood O
sugar O
as O
19 O


I O
am O






wondering O
if O
she O
is O
remembering O
all O
these O
blood O
sugars O
correctly O








She O
had O
no O
shakiness O

no O
loss O
of O
consciousness O

no O
dizziness O

no O






nothing O


She O
felt O
totally O
normal O


So O
hopefully O
she O
will O
really O






record O
these O
and O
we O
will O
get O
a O
better O
idea O


She O
said O
this O
always O






happens O
in O
the O
morning O


She O
kept O
contradicting O
herself O
and O
had O
no O






documentation O


I O
went O
over O
with O
her O
the O
symptoms O
of O
hypoglycemia O








Once O
she O
had O
a O
low O
blood O
sugar O
by O
fingerstick O


She O
does O
drink O
juice O







but O
I O
went O
over O
the O
symptoms O
again O
with O
her O


She O
will O
call O
me O
if O
she O






does O
have O
any O

Tylenol O

She O

her O

when O

I O
asked O
her O
if O

she O
said O
that O
she O

It O

happening O
for O
a O

both O
agreed O
that O
these O
do O
sound O
like O

I O
will O
not O
image O
her O

as O
there O
is O
no O

HISTORY O

Ms O

Youngman PATIENT
returns O

to O

follow O
up O
regarding O
her O
diabetes O

coronary O
artery O
disease O

and O

depression O


Since O
I O
last O
saw O
her O

she O
presented O
to O
Urgent O
Care O

complaining O
of O
some O
epigastric O
discomfort O
and O
was O
referred O
to O

Gastroenterology O
where O
apparently O
she O
was O
started O
on O
Prevacid O
at O
30mg O
a O

day O
in O
addition O
to O
maintenance O
with O
q O
h O

Zantac O
and O
scheduled O
for O
a O

with O
a O
small O

follow O
through O

a O
plan O
to O
add O
a O

pro O

agent O
if O
there O
was O
no O
structural O
abnormalities O
on O
her O
GI O

study O


She O
is O
scheduled O
later O
this O
month O


She O
has O
no O
new O
complaints O


although O
she O
recently O
stopped O
taking O
her O
glyburide O
and O
has O
not O
refilled O

it O
over O
the O
past O
two O
days O


She O
denies O
any O
increasing O
polyuria O


polydipsia O

polyphagia O


Says O
until O
yesterday O

she O
had O
been O
taking O
all O

of O
her O
medications O
regularly O

although O
mostly O
at O
night O
rather O
than O
in O

the O
morning O


I O
pressed O
her O
about O
this O
because O
she O
has O
a O
history O
of O

being O
noncompliant O
with O
her O
medicines O
in O
the O
past O

but O
she O
does O
maintain O

that O
she O
has O
been O
taking O
them O


It O
is O
not O
entirely O
clear O
to O
me O
whether O

this O
is O
true O
or O
not O




Regarding O
her O
depression O

she O
denies O
any O
suicidal O
ideation O


She O
says O

she O
is O
feeling O
a O
little O
bit O
better O


She O
was O
recently O
started O
on O

risperidone O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
Celexa O

Mr O

Eubanks PATIENT
was O
in O
his O
usual O
state O
of O
health O
until O
3 O
days O
prior O

when O
he O
developed O
two O
episodes O
of O
low O
grade O
chest O
pain O

once O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
once O
in O
the O
evening O


These O
episodes O
lasted O
only O
1 O
2 O
minutes O

and O
seemed O
to O
him O
to O
be O
related O
to O
his O
ongoing O
issues O
with O
gout O


The O
chest O
pain O
was O
not O
associated O
with O
shortness O
of O

and O
seemed O
to O
improve O
with O
indomethacin O

which O
he O
typically O
takes O

acute O
exacerbations O
of O
gout O


His O

of O
his O

but O
not O
to O
the O

Associated O
with O
the O
chest O

man O
with O
HTN O

DM O
II O

and O
gout O

who O
presents O
with O
2 O
hours O
of O
severe O
chest O
pain O


The O
differential O
for O
chest O
pain O
is O
broad O
and O
includes O
cardiac O
ischemia O

myocardial O
infarction O

aortic O
dissection O

pneumothorax O

pulmonary O
embolus O

bronchitis O

pleurisy O

GERD O
esophageal O
spasm O

musculoskeletal O
chest O
wall O
pain O

and O
anxiety O


The O
sudden O
onset O
of O
severe O
chest O
pain O

awaking O
him O
from O
sleep O

raises O
the O
probability O
of O
an O
acute O
cardiac O
or O
pulmonary O
event O
such O
as O
MI O

aortic O
dissection O

or O
PE O


The O
patient O
has O
elevated O

but O
otherwise O
lacks O
physical O
exam O

hemoptysis O

tachypnea O

signs O
of O
DVT O

or O
CT O

imaging O
features O
consistent O
with O
pulmonary O
embolism O


The O
patient O


s O
HTN O
is O
a O
risk O
factor O
for O
aortic O
dissection O

but O
this O
diagnosis O
can O
be O
ruled O
out O
by O
negative O
CXR O
and O
CTA O
scans O

which O
have O
80 O




95 O

In O
addition O

he O
lacks O
a O
number O
of O
other O
clinical O
manifestations O
of O

including O
syncope O

The O
distribution O
of O

Moreover O

the O
patient O
has O
had O
two O
similar O
but O
less O
severe O
attacks O
a O
few O
days O
ago O

and O
has O
multiple O
cardiac O
risk O
factors O


This O
makes O
unstable O
angina O
or O
myocardial O
infarction O
the O
most O
likely O
diagnosis O



EKG O
changes O
lacked O
ST O

The O
patient O
may O
have O
either O
a O
non O

The O
plan O
will O
be O
to O
continue O

has O
been O
reasonably O
stable O


She O
still O
remains O
with O

difficulty O
in O
controlling O
her O
blood O
sugar O


She O
has O
continued O
difficulty O
with O

her O
oral O
cavity O


She O
has O
had O
no O
extraglandular O
symptoms O



specifically O


polyneuropathy O

myopathy O

or O
purpura O


She O
uses O
artificial O
tears O
and O

She O
remains O
on O
insulin O

She O
has O
a O
one O
week O
history O
of O
pain O
and O
swelling O
of O
her O
left O
wrist O


She O
was O

seen O
at O
the O
Graduate HOSPITAL
Hospital HOSPITAL
Emergency O
Room O
several O
days O
ago O


Radiographs O
of O
the O

wrist O
show O
chondrocalcinosis O


She O
was O
started O
on O
Motrin O
with O
some O
response O

but O
still O
has O
active O
symptoms O


She O
is O
wearing O
a O
splint O


Today O
on O
exam O

she O
is O
afebrile O


There O
was O
OA O
involving O
the O
DIP O
joints O


PIPs O

and O
MCPs O
were O
nontender O


The O
left O
wrist O
showed O
swelling O

heat O
with O

diminished O

showed O
full O
range O
of O

did O
not O
show O
active O
synovitis O



There O
was O
no O
adenopathy O
and O
lungs O
were O
clear O


I O
aspirated O
the O
left O
wrist O
under O
sterile O
technique O


No O
fluid O
was O
obtained O



I O
injected O
it O
with O
40 O
mg O
of O
Depo O
Medrol O


Clinically O

I O
think O
she O
has O
had O
pseudogout O


She O
has O
chondrocalcinosis O
on O

radiograph O
and O
has O
a O
clinical O
picture O
consistent O
with O

disease O


In O

addition O

she O
has O
primary O
Sjogren O
s O


The O
two O
diseases O
are O
unrelated O


In O
addition O
to O
injection O
of O
her O
wrist O

I O
switched O
her O
from O
Motrin O
to O
Celebrex O

200 O
mg O
twice O
a O
day O
due O
to O
side O
effect O

She O
should O
probably O

take O
that O
for O
about O
five O
to O
seven O
days O


Side O
effects O
were O
reviewed O


I O
would O
like O
to O
see O
her O

She O
will O

you O

for O

ASSESSMENT O



1 O


Neuropathy O


The O
patient O
has O
likely O
multifactorial O
reasons O
for O
his O
lumbar O
spine O
pain O


He O
did O
undergo O
an O
evaluation O
by O
Dr O


Ulysses DOCTOR
Harding DOCTOR
which O
is O
unavailable O
at O
this O
time O
and O
one O
cortisone O
injection O
which O
was O
not O
effective O
at O
relieving O
his O
discomfort O


He O
likely O
has O
a O
combination O
of O
diabetic O
peripheral O
neuropathy O

sciatic O
neuropathy O
and O
possible O
lumbosacral O
spinal O
stenosis O
or O
polyradiculopathy O


There O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
diabetic O
amyotrophy O


I O
think O
at O
this O
point O

an O
EMG O
with O
nerve O
conduction O
studies O
will O
be O
most O
helpful O
to O
identify O
the O
relevant O
contributions O
of O
these O
different O
factors O


I O
have O
also O
suggested O
that O
he O
invest O
in O
suspenders O
and O
carry O
his O
wallet O
in O
a O
different O
pocket O
to O
see O
if O
this O
will O
provide O
some O
relief O


He O
has O
tried O
a O
course O
of O
non O
steroidals O
without O
effect O
and O
I O
think O
I O
would O
like O
to O
begin O
with O
a O
low O
dose O
of O
amitriptyline O
as O
a O
neuropathic O
pain O
agent O
to O
supplement O
the O
Neurontin O
that O
he O
is O
on O
for O
other O
indications O


I O
will O
see O
him O
back O
in O
the O
office O
after O
the O
EMG O
has O
been O
performed O
and O
I O
have O
had O
a O
chance O
to O
review O
the O
MR O
imaging O





Thank O
you O
for O
sending O
him O
to O
my O
office O

it O
is O
a O
pleasure O
taking O
care O
of O
this O
gentleman O
and O
I O
am O
hopeful O
that O
we O
will O
be O
able O
to O
reduce O
his O
discomfort O
to O
some O
degree O

came O
into O

insists O
that O
she O
wanted O

me O
today O
even O
though O
it O
is O
not O
an O

She O
was O
instructed O

I O
was O
able O
to O
see O
her O

Interval O
History O





Ms O

Neill PATIENT
was O
recently O
evaluated O
at O
Janesville HOSPITAL
Clinic HOSPITAL
for O
her O
dyspnea O


She O
was O
concerned O
that O
her O
dyspnea O
was O
related O
to O
her O
lungs O
and O
I O
believe O
self O
referred O
to O
Janesville HOSPITAL
for O
further O
evaluation O






She O
was O
found O
by O
cardiac O
echo O
there O
to O
have O
significant O
decrease O
in O
her O
ejection O
fraction O
to O
15 O



Previously O
here O
last O
fall DATE
her O
ejection O
fraction O
measured O
43 O



She O
had O
global O
hypokinesis O




She O
was O
hospitalized O
at O
Janesville HOSPITAL
and O
had O
an O
abnormal O
set O
of O
pulmonary O
function O
tests O
showing O
moderate O
restrictive O
disease O


She O
had O
some O
air O

Previous O
CTA O
in O
the O

had O
been O
negative O
for O
pulmonary O
embolus O


Because O
of O
continued O
suspicion O
about O
PE O
she O
underwent O
pulmonary O
arterogram O
which O
was O
unremarkable O


A O
repeat O
VQ O
scan O
after O
a O
normal O
PA O
gram O
showed O
some O
persistence O
in O
the O
left O
lower O
lobe O
defect O
and O
ultimately O
it O
was O
felt O
that O
she O
did O
not O
have O
evidence O
of O
any O
thromboembolic O
pulmonary O
vascular O
disease O


Of O
note O
pulmonary O

Ms O

Tinsley PATIENT
was O
given O
a O
partial O
dose O
of O
Vancomycin O
and O
developed O
pruritus O


CBC O
at O

time O
revealed O
a O
white O
count O
of O
6 O
2 O
with O
a O
hematocrit O
of O

Blood O
cultures O
were O
sent O



On O
examination O
today O
this O
lady O
appeared O
well O
with O
a O

of O
110 O
60 O
and O
a O
pulse O

She O
was O
afebrile O


Head O

neck O
examination O
was O
unremarkable O
and O

was O
clear O
to O
IPPA O


On O
cardiovascular O

JVP O
was O

there O
was O
no O

were O
normal O

did O
not O
reveal O

white O

Miss O
Tinsley PATIENT
should O
be O
followed O
up O
at O
her O
dialysis O
center O


There O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
any O
evidence O
of O
a O
graft O
infection O


She O
should O
also O
have O
a O
urine O
sent O
for O
culture O
to O
rule O
out O
urinary O
tract O
infection O


Because O
of O
her O
early O
satiety O
she O
has O
been O
eating O
poorly O
and O
we O
might O
suggest O
that O
she O
be O
started O
on O
a O
gastroprokinetic O
agent O
such O
as O
Cisapride O
10 O
mg O

Dear O
Dr O

I O
was O

to O
provide O
a O
cardiologic O
evaluation O
on O
Mrs O

Tinsley PATIENT
with O
a O
concentration O
on O
her O
appropriateness O
to O
be O
listed O
as O
a O
recipient O
for O
a O
cadaver O
renal O
transplant O


In O
summary O

she O
is O
a O
46 AGE
year O
old O
woman O
who O
has O
been O
an O
insulin O
dependent O
diabetic O
since O
the O
age O
of O
29 AGE
and O
has O
been O
on O

By O

her O
other O

In O
viewing O
her O

she O

the O
Houghton ORGANIZATION

Her O
three O

She O
does O

however O


experience O
occasional O
chest O
pressure O
with O
activities O
and O
on O
rare O
occasions O
has O
had O
nocturnal O
angina O


These O
episodes O
are O
relieved O
by O
nitroglycerin O


Mrs O

Tinsley PATIENT
has O
also O
noted O
that O
with O
walking O
she O
will O
occasionally O
get O
short O
of O
breath O
which O
is O
relieved O
by O
slowing O
down O










In O
addition O

A O
report O
of O
an O

from O

shows O
mild O
ventricular O
hypertrophy O
in O
the O
presence O
of O
mitral O

preserved O
LV O
size O

function O


She O
had O
an O

in O
February DATE

2085 DATE


On O
a O
modified O
protocol O

she O
went O
for O
less O
than O
4 O
1 O
2 O
minutes O


This O
is O
equivalent O
to O
not O
even O
completing O
stage O
1 O
of O
the O
standard O
Bruce O


With O
that O

she O
did O
develop O
chest O
pain O
and O
had O
2 O
mm O
of O
ST O
depression O

That O
study O
was O
accompanied O
by O
both O
fixed O

reversible O
isotopic O
perfusion O
changes O
in O
the O

consistent O
with O

As O
was O
apparent O
to O
those O
involved O

even O
the O
non O
isotope O
portion O
alone O
was O
worrisome O
for O
high O
grade O
coronary O
disease O
and O
led O
to O
the O
recommendation O
for O
a O
cardiac O
catheterization O










That O
study O
was O
done O
in O
Macdonald HOSPITAL
Hospital HOSPITAL
and O
at O
this O
time O

I O
only O
have O
the O
report O


However O

from O
this O
report O

there O
was O
preserved O
LV O
function O
with O
anterior O
lateral O
hypokinesis O
and O
trace O
MR O
that O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O

Coronary O
angiography O
showed O

diffuse O
involvement O
of O
proximal O

until O
an O
80 O

mid O

LAD O


The O
circumflex O
was O
also O
diffusely O
diseased O
and O
there O
was O
a O
discrete O
stenosis O
in O
the O
mid O
section O
of O
a O
large O
marginal O


The O
right O
coronary O
artery O
was O
diffusely O
diseased O
with O
a O
discrete O
stenosis O


At O
that O
time O

the O
recommendation O
was O
to O
continue O
medical O
therapy O










Her O
medical O
therapy O
at O
this O
time O
is O
estrogen O
replacement O
with O
prempro O
2 O
5 O
mg O
once O
a O

tenormin O

one O
every O
other O
day O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
supplemental O
vitamins O

iron O
and O
twice O
daily O
insulin O
therapy O










In O
rounding O
out O
her O
medical O
history O

her O
surgical O
procedures O
have O
involved O
the O
hemodialysis O
access O


She O
has O
had O
one O
pregnancy O
28 O
years O
ago O
without O
complications O


I O
also O
elicited O
a O
history O
of O
some O
focal O
arm O
weakness O
and O
occasional O
slurring O
of O
speech O


This O
was O
difficult O
to O
pin O
down O

but O
is O
of O
some O
concern O








On O
exam O

her O
blood O
pressure O
was O
150 O
80 O

mm O
Hg O

pulse O
90 O
regular O

her O
weight O
95 O
lbs O


Her O
hemodialysis O
shunt O
is O
on O
the O
left O
arm O


There O
was O
a O
right O
carotid O
bruit O

neck O
veins O
were O
not O
distended O


Lungs O
were O
clear O

PMI O
was O
displaced O
and O
sustained O


There O
was O
an O
S4 O

no O
S3 O
and O
there O
was O
a O
holo O
systolic O
murmur O
at O
the O
apex O


Abdomen O
was O
benign O

femoral O
pulses O
were O
intact O

extremities O
were O
without O
edema O


The O
electrocardiogram O
showed O
sinus O
rhythm O

diffuse O
STT O
changes O


There O
were O
no O
pathologic O
Q O
waves O








Although O
the O
focus O
of O
this O
evaluation O
was O
originally O
for O
transplant O
candidacy O

I O
am O
concerned O
about O
her O
current O
cardiac O
status O


She O
is O
a O
young O
diabetic O
woman O

symptomatic O
of O
both O
shortness O
of O
breath O
and O
chest O
pain O
and O
on O
exercise O
test O

has O
limited O
functional O
capacity O


The O
coronary O
angiography O
reveals O
a O
presence O
of O
multi O
vessel O
disease O


Even O
without O
seeing O
the O
primary O
data O
which O
I O
hope O
to O
do O
in O
the O
next O
week O

it O
would O
be O
unlikely O
that O
she O
would O
be O
an O
angioplasty O
candidate O

given O
the O
poor O
results O
in O
diabetics O



Therefore O

coronary O
revascularization O
for O
her O
would O
be O
coronary O
artery O

bypass O
surgery O











Obviously O

I O
would O
like O
to O
review O
the O
films O
first O

and O
speak O
with O
Dr O

Upson DOCTOR
regarding O
augmentation O
of O
her O
anti O
anginals O


I O
would O
also O
like O
to O
add O
pravastatin O
at O
this O
time O

starting O
with O
only O
10 O
mg O
and O
obtain O
non O
invasive O
studies O
of O
the O
carotids O


As O
indicated O

although O
the O
focus O
of O
this O
evaluation O
was O
her O
suitability O
for O
transplantation O

the O
issue O
of O
controlling O
symptomatic O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
in O
this O
young O
woman O
became O
more O
pressing O








I O
look O
forward O
to O
working O
with O
you O
and O
the O
other O
physicians O
in O
her O
care O

raises O
the O
possibility O
of O
a O
post O

now O

Other O

other O
forms O

chronic O
glomerulonephritis O

systemic O
lupus O

given O
the O

Nevertheless O

I O
agree O
that O

not O

at O

given O
the O
advanced O
nature O

her O
disease O

the O
increased O
risk O
due O
to O
her O
body O

I O
discussed O
several O
options O
in O
renal O
replacement O
therapy O
with O
Ms O

Vincent PATIENT

Although O
she O
has O
no O
medical O
conditions O
which O
would O
preclude O
living O
related O
or O
cadaveric O
kidney O
transplantation O

her O
obesity O
and O
glucose O
intolerance O
along O
with O
the O
history O
of O
hidradenitis O
make O
transplantation O
a O
less O
attractive O
option O


I O
have O
encouraged O
Ms O

Vincent PATIENT
to O
attempt O
a O
gradual O
weight O
loss O
program O
in O
order O
to O
improve O
her O
fitness O
prior O
to O
either O
dialysis O
or O
transplantation O


Nevertheless O

her O
appearance O
is O
quite O
reminiscent O
of O
Cushing O
s O
disease O

and O
this O
should O
be O
worked O
up O
if O
it O
has O
not O
been O
performed O
previously O



I O
have O
arranged O
an O
iothalamate O

more O
closely O
approximate O
her O

function O
and O
a O
follow O
up O

In O
summary O

Mrs O

Vincent PATIENT
appears O
to O
be O
developing O
early O
symptoms O
of O
uremia O


Given O
her O
advanced O
azotemia O
we O
believe O
that O
she O
should O
undergo O
creation O
of O
an O
arteriovenous O
fistula O
so O
that O
she O
may O
start O
dialysis O
within O
the O
next O
several O
months O

We O
have O
arranged O
to O
recheck O
her O
chemistries O
today O


We O
would O
also O
recommend O
that O
she O
undergo O
repeat O
work O
up O
for O
her O
cushingoid O
features O


Although O
renal O
failure O
may O
alter O
hormonal O
balance O
and O
may O
promote O
occasional O
androgenic O
features O
in O
woman O

this O
is O
beyond O

Thank O
you O

who O

appointment O
and O
he O
feels O
increased O

He O
said O
that O
his O

has O
been O

sick O

so O
he O
has O
been O
spending O
a O
significant O
amount O
of O
time O

helping O
him O

We O

the O
renal O

fellow O
who O
recommended O
that O
we O
proceed O
dialysis O
while O
the O

dialysis O
unit O
still O
open O
and O
we O
felt O
that O
it O
was O
safe O
for O
this O

patient O


His O
potassium O
was O
not O
back O
at O
the O
time O
that O
he O
left O
the O

department O

however O

he O
was O
well O
appearing O
and O
had O
no O
arrhythmias O

on O
the O
monitor O
and O
we O
think O
that O
his O
tickling O
chest O
sensation O
is O

very O
atypical O
for O
cardiac O
symptom O

not O
being O

so O
we O
will O
reassess O

when O
he O
comes O
back O
and O
likely O
check O
a O
second O
troponin O
to O
be O
sure O

that O
this O
is O
unlikely O
to O
be O
acute O

the O
patient O
on O

Unit O
and O
agreed O

him O
there O

Again O
after O

the O

the O
Emergency O
Department O


We O
will O
reassess O
if O

how O

If O
he O

he O
continues O

we O

that O

that O

imaging O
with O
a O
CT O
scan O
which O
I O
reviewed O
but O
do O
not O
have O
the O
written O
report O

This O
shows O
a O
mass O
in O
the O
head O
of O
the O
pancreas O
abutting O
and O
perhaps O
distorting O
the O
portal O

He O
has O
not O
had O
any O
jaundice O
and O
does O
not O
have O
any O
change O
in O
his O
bowel O
functions O

A O
subsequent O
endoscopic O
ultrasound O
examination O
confirms O
the O
mass O
in O
the O
head O
of O
the O
pancreas O
with O
features O
of O
portal O

invasion O

Fine O
needle O

has O
confirmed O
adenocarcinoma O

The O
mass O
itself O
is O
about O
2 O

His O
family O
history O
does O
not O
include O
any O
pancreatic O
cancer O
but O
his O
father O
had O
lung O
cancer O


He O
denies O
smoking O

about O
5 O
days O

His O
current O

include O
Lipitor O
40mg O

said O
to O
be O
allergic O
to O
Sudafed O

the O

used O

the O

was O
apparently O

it O
is O

His O

He O

His O

is O
otherwise O
unremarkable O


I O
think O
he O
is O
not O
a O
candidate O
for O
attempted O
surgical O
resection O
at O
this O
time O

With O
the O
findings O
consistent O
with O
portal O
vein O
invasion O

he O
should O
first O
be O
treated O
with O
chemoradiation O

He O
may O
be O
a O
candidate O
for O
subsequent O
surgery O

probably O
not O
resection O
but O
perhaps O
intra O
operative O
radiation O
therapy O

I O


ve O
explained O
this O
to O
him O

his O
wife O
and O

After O
discussing O
the O
various O
alternatives O
we O
have O
agreed O
to O
have O
him O
evaluated O
in O
the O
Sawtooth HOSPITAL
Cancer HOSPITAL
Clinic HOSPITAL
for O
treatment O
planning O
for O
chemoradiation O

with O
consideration O
of O

He O

to O
have O
his O

I O

is O
a O
64 AGE

with O
an O
extensive O
past O
medical O

history O
for O
a O
rheumatological O

His O
past O
medical O
history O


briefly O

is O
that O
he O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
lupus O
in O
2103 DATE

at O
that O

time O
he O
had O
a O
butterfly O

he O
complained O
of O
chronic O

and O

he O
also O
had O
what O
was O

temporal O

were O

characterized O

and O
elevated O

80 O
and O
ANA O
of O
1 O

with O
a O
homogenous O

All O
of O
these O
suggested O
that O
the O
patient O
did O
have O
lupus O


He O
was O

treated O
for O
approximately O
three O
years O
with O
prednisone O
and O
he O
notes O

that O

his O

went O
away O


Since O
that O

it O

which O
is O
there O
every O

and O

has O
a O
combination O
of O
