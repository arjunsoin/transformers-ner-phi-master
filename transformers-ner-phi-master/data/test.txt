Dear O
Dr O

I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Mr O

Hess PATIENT
in O
followup O
in O
Cardiology O
today O


As O
you O
know O

he O
is O
a O
53 AGE
year O
old O
gentleman O
who O
underwent O
implantation O
of O
a O
permanent O
pacemaker O
on O
02 DATE
11 DATE
60 DATE
for O
presyncope O
and O
pauses O
on O
Holter O
monitoring O


His O
past O
medical O
history O
is O
significant O
for O
hyperlipidemia O

gastroesophageal O
reflux O
disease O

and O
asthma O


Prior O
to O
his O
pacemaker O
placement O

an O
exercise O
stress O
test O
was O
performed O
because O
of O
his O
history O
of O
exertional O
chest O
pain O


He O
was O
able O
to O
exercise O
for O
8 O
minutes O
and O
4 O
seconds O


The O
test O
was O
terminated O
for O
7 O
10 O
substernal O
chest O
pain O

but O
no O
hypotension O
and O
no O
overt O
EKG O
changes O
were O
noted O

so O
we O
proceeded O
with O
the O
pacemaker O
implant O


Since O
the O
implant O
Mr O

Hess PATIENT
describes O
that O
his O
intermittent O
symptoms O
of O
lightheadedness O
and O
shortness O
of O
breath O
have O
vanished O

however O

he O
has O
noticed O
that O
he O
is O
sleeping O
less O
well O
and O
occasionally O
has O
nocturnal O
palpitations O

which O
potentially O
could O
represent O
pacing O
from O
his O
pacemaker O


Interrogation O
today O
of O
his O
Medtronic O
Kappa O
QQ DEVICE
626 DEVICE
pacemaker O
reveals O
that O
his O
underlying O
rhythm O
is O
sinus O
tachycardia O
with O
intact O
AV O
conduction O


His O
estimated O
battery O
longevity O
is O
89 O
months O


The O
atrial O
impedance O
is O
569 O
ohms O

the O
ventricular O
impedance O
is O

ohms O


The O
P O
wave O

and O
the O
threshold O
in O
the O
ventricle O
is O
0 O
75 O
V O
at O
0 O
4 O
msec O


In O
summary O

Mr O

Hess PATIENT
is O
doing O
extremely O
well O
after O
his O
pacemaker O
placement O


His O
pacemaker O
incision O
is O
extremely O
well O
healed O


There O
is O
no O
sign O
of O
erythema O
or O
hematoma O


However O

his O
sinus O
tachycardia O
is O
mildly O
perplexing O


Looking O
at O
his O
heart O
rate O
histogram O

it O
appears O
that O
this O
sinus O
rates O
have O
varied O
from O
80 O
120 O
beats O
per O
minute O
for O
the O
most O
part O
aside O
from O
some O
low O
heart O
rate O
that O
potentially O
are O
nocturnal O


I O
have O
performed O
some O
pacing O
maneuvers O
today O
in O
clinic O
to O
attempt O
to O
determine O
whether O
the O
mechanism O
of O
his O
current O
tachycardia O
is O
sinus O
and O
it O
appears O
that O
this O
is O
sinus O
tachycardia O


For O
this O
reason O

I O
have O
performed O
a O
TSH O
today O

which O
is O
normal O

however O

I O
suggest O
to O
you O
that O
potentially O
a O
cursory O
endocrine O
workup O
and O
potentially O
a O
repeat O
echocardiogram O
at O
your O
facility O
might O
be O
indicated O


I O
am O
available O
to O
discuss O
these O
findings O
with O
you O
at O
any O
time O


I O
plan O
to O
see O
Mr O

Hess PATIENT
in O
followup O
in O
three O
months O

time O

and O
if O
any O
issues O
arise O
in O
the O
interim O

please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
contact O
me O

In O
summary O

the O
pacemaker O
appears O
to O
be O
working O
quite O
well O


However O

Mr O

Hess PATIENT
persists O
in O
a O
perplexing O
sinus O
tachycardia O
that O
has O
been O
present O
since O
his O
last O
pacemaker O
interrogation O


I O
have O
therefore O
ordered O
an O
echocardiogram O
to O
rule O
out O
any O
ill O
effects O
of O
the O
sinus O
tachycardia O
or O
any O
structural O
heart O
disease O
that O
may O
be O
causing O
the O
sinus O
tachycardia O


In O
addition O

I O
have O
performed O
a O
12 O
lead O
ECG O

which O
appears O
to O
show O
sinus O
mechanism O
rather O
than O
an O
atrial O
tachycardia O


Today O
in O
the O
office O

his O
sinus O
rate O
is O
109 O
beats O
per O
minute O
with O
stable O
blood O
pressure O


Mr O

Hess PATIENT
and O
I O
have O
checked O
thyroid O
studies O
in O
the O
recent O
past O
and O
those O
have O
been O
unremarkable O






I O
have O
discussed O
this O
case O
with O
Dr O

Quatrell DOCTOR
Swanson DOCTOR
who O
has O
agreed O
to O
assist O
in O
Cardiology O
care O
for O
Mr O

Hess PATIENT
in O
the O
near O
future O

since O
Dr O

Law DOCTOR
is O
moving O
his O
practice O
to O
the O
NCHC HOSPITAL


I O
plan O
to O
see O
Mr O

Hess PATIENT
in O
followup O
in O
three O
months O

time O
for O
his O
pacemaker O


If O
any O
issues O
arise O
in O
the O
interim O

please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
contact O
me O

Dear O
Wanda DOCTOR



Nancy PATIENT
Werner PATIENT
is O
doing O
better O
than O
the O
last O
time O
I O
saw O
her O
in O
May DATE
in O
that O
the O
triglycerides O
have O
decreased O
to O
460 O

pretty O
much O
where O
they O
had O
usually O
been O


The O
LDL O
is O
now O
quite O
low O
at O
93 O
but O
the O
HDL O
has O
declined O
to O
34 O


All O
in O
all O

the O
results O
are O
compatible O
with O
better O
glucose O
control O
and O
the O
action O
of O
Atorvastatin O
10 O
mg O
is O
likely O
responsible O
for O
the O
very O
low O
LDL O
but O
on O
the O
other O
hand O
discontinuation O
of O
the O
gemfibrozil O
probably O
lowered O
the O
HDL O


The O
effect O
on O
triglycerides O
of O
the O
low O
dose O
of O
the O
Atorvastatin O
is O
minimal O
and O
overall O
the O
triglyceride O
lowering O
effect O
is O
overrated O
except O
at O
the O
high O
dose O
of O
80 O
mg O


Even O
at O
80 O
mg O
Atorvastatin O
could O
not O
compare O
to O
the O
fibrates O
in O
the O
triglyceride O
lowering O
action O



Her O

are O
Atorvastatin O

and O
left O
her O

Although O

expect O
any O
side O

with O
this O
low O
dose O
of O
Atorvastatin O
and O
Gemfibrozil O
I O
warned O
Mrs O

her O
husband O
that O
if O
she O

she O

Dear O

Your O

office O
today O

a O
follow O

As O
you O
know O

Mr O

Branche PATIENT
underwent O
a O
left O
femoral O
to O
posterior O
tibial O
bypass O
one O
month O
ago O
followed O
by O
amputation O
of O
a O
gangrenous O
first O
toe O

After O
being O
discharged O
from O
our O
service O
he O
was O
readmitted O
to O
the O
Medical O
Service O
with O
a O
severe O
case O
of O
C O

difficile O
colitis O


Ultimately O
this O
resolved O
and O
he O
was O
discharged O


Today O
he O
reports O
that O
the O
diarrhea O
has O
again O
resumed O
and O
he O
was O
placed O
back O
on O
an O
oral O
antibiotic O
yesterday O


He O
complains O
of O
only O
mild O
incisional O
discomfort O
in O
his O
left O
leg O



On O
examination O

there O
is O
a O
strong O
pulse O
easily O
palpated O
over O
the O
left O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
graft O


The O
old O
right O
lower O
extremity O

graft O
was O
also O
palpable O

The O
left O
foot O
itself O
is O
warm O


The O
great O
toe O
incision O
site O

however O

has O
developed O
necrotic O
tissue O
all O
along O
the O
incision O

which O
was O
sharply O
debrided O
to O
clean O
margins O


This O
will O
now O
need O
to O
be O
treated O
as O
an O
open O
wound O


The O
calf O
portion O
of O
the O
left O
lower O
extremity O
incision O
also O
has O
a O
narrow O
zone O
of O
superficial O
skin O
slough O
which O
was O
gently O
debrided O


The O
graft O
is O
not O
exposed O
and O
there O
are O
no O
deep O
wounds O
in O
the O
leg O



Mr O

Branche PATIENT
s O
left O
lower O
extremity O

graft O
is O
functioning O
well O

However O

he O
will O

for O
the O

Dear O
Dr O

Xayarath DOCTOR



Your O

Earnest PATIENT
Branch PATIENT
came O
in O
the O

today O
for O
a O
follow O
up O

Mr O

Branch PATIENT
is O
now O
two O
years O
out O
from O
a O
right O
femoral O

tibial O
bypass O
and O
nine O
months O
out O
from O
a O

tibial O

bypass O
with O
subsequent O
transmetatarsal O
amputation O
of O
the O
left O
foot O

and O
split O
thickness O
skin O
grafting O


Over O
the O
last O
several O
months O


he O
has O
been O
undergoing O
dressing O
changes O
to O
remaining O

small O


superficial O

open O
wounds O
on O
the O
dorsum O
of O
the O
left O
foot O


Over O
the O

last O
one O
to O
two O
weeks O

he O
began O
to O
note O
the O
development O
of O
a O
new O

area O
of O
dark O
skin O
on O
the O
lateral O
aspect O
of O
the O
left O
foot O
and O

recently O
has O
noted O
some O
drainage O


He O
denies O
any O
fevers O


In O

addition O
and O
of O
note O

he O
complains O
of O
recent O
onset O
of O
pain O
in O
the O

right O
eye O
and O
has O
an O
appointment O
at O
the O
Ophthalmology O
Clinic O

immediately O
following O
his O
visit O
with O
us O


He O
last O
underwent O

vascular O
lab O
studies O
in O
September DATE
at O
which O
time O
both O
lower O

extremity O
bypass O
grafts O
were O
widely O
patent O
and O
without O
stenoses O



On O
examination O
today O

there O
are O
strong O

easily O
palpable O
pulses O

over O
both O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
grafts O


The O
right O
foot O
is O
warm O

and O
without O
any O
new O
ischemic O
skin O
changes O
or O
lesions O


On O

examination O
of O
the O
left O
foot O

there O
is O
a O
large O
area O
of O
full O

thickness O
skin O
necrosis O
on O
the O
lateral O
aspect O
of O
the O
foot O
where O

there O
had O
never O
been O
any O
previous O
open O
wounds O


This O
area O

encompasses O
a O
significant O
proportion O
of O
the O
lateral O
aspect O
of O
the O

foot O
from O
the O
end O
of O
the O
transmetatarsal O
incision O
to O
the O
proximal O

mid O
foot O


On O
probing O

purulent O
material O
drains O
from O
the O
margins O

and O
there O
is O
obvious O
significant O
sepsis O


The O
foot O
itself O
is O
warm O

and O
there O
is O
a O
good O
posterior O
tibial O
Doppler O
signal O
at O
the O
ankle O



Unfortunately O

Mr O

Branch PATIENT
has O
developed O
a O
new O

large O
wound O
on O
the O

left O
foot O
which O
likely O
began O
as O
a O
pressure O

decubitus O

ulceration O

due O
to O
his O
severe O
neuropathy O


This O
is O
now O
complicated O
by O

significant O
local O
sepsis O
and O
there O
is O
a O
large O
area O
of O
soft O
tissue O

loss O
on O
the O
foot O


He O
will O
require O
urgent O
admission O
and O
operative O

debridement O
today O


In O
addition O

given O
the O
extent O
of O
the O
problem O


it O
is O
likely O
that O
he O
will O
ultimately O
come O
to O
below O
knee O

in O

Immediately O
following O

The O

she O
had O
a O
preemptive O

She O
does O
have O
a O

but O
apparently O
the O
Transplant O
Service O
feels O
that O
she O
would O
not O
be O
a O
good O
candidate O
and O
I O
think O
she O
would O
be O
reluctant O
to O
go O
through O
two O

which O
would O
be O
required O

one O
to O
remove O
the O

Assessment O

In O
summary O

this O
is O
a O
78 AGE
year O
old O
gentleman O
who O
has O
a O
history O
of O
coronary O
artery O
bypass O
grafting O

closure O
of O
PFO O

and O
ligation O
of O
the O
left O
atrial O
appendage O
and O
Maze O
procedure O
which O
was O
done O
in O
July DATE
2096 DATE

His O
anginal O
equivalent O
prior O
to O
that O
was O
dyspnea O
on O
exertion O
and O
he O
did O
well O
for O
a O
period O
of O
time O
but O
now O
has O
dyspnea O
on O
exertion O
again O

There O
are O
a O
number O
of O
factors O
involved O
here O

He O
has O
atrial O
fibrillation O
which O
is O
now O
recurrent O
but O
the O
rate O
seems O
to O
be O
reasonably O
well O
controlled O

I O
doubt O
that O

that O
is O
playing O
a O
role O
in O
his O
shortness O
of O
breath O

He O
also O
has O
a O
history O
of O
plural O
effusions O
which O
could O
have O
been O
contributing O
to O
shortness O
of O
breath O
as O
well O
and O
that O
has O
been O
dealt O
with O
corrosion O
of O
the O
pleura O

He O
has O
mitral O
regurgitation O
which O
in O
the O
past O
was O
said O
to O
be O
moderate O
and O
he O
has O
had O
the O
closure O
of O
PFO O

He O
has O
insulin O
dependent O
diabetes O
and O
hypertension O

He O
also O
has O
low O
platelets O

The O
recurrence O
of O
the O
exertional O
dyspnea O
is O
certainly O
worrisome O
for O
recurrence O
of O
coronary O
disease O
particularly O
with O
the O
exercise O
test O
showing O
anterior O
wall O
ischemia O

It O
may O
be O
that O
there O
are O
other O
issues O
contributing O
to O
this O

the O
atrial O
fibrillation O
and O
mitral O
regurgitation O

He O
has O
murmur O
consistent O
with O
mitral O
regurgitation O

but O
he O
has O
no O
evidence O
of O
decompensated O
congestive O
failure O
at O
this O
time O

Blood O
pressure O
is O
elevated O
somewhat O
and O
I O
think O
that O
increase O
in O
his O
Avapro O
might O
be O
worthwhile O

He O
also O
has O
chronic O
renal O
insufficiency O
which O
makes O
things O
more O
complicated O
as O
well O

My O
feeling O
is O
that O
we O
are O
dealing O
with O
recurrence O
of O
coronary O
disease O
and O
I O
spoke O
with O
the O
patient O
about O
this O

He O
is O
clearly O
limited O
in O
his O
exercise O
capacity O
and O
wants O
to O
have O
something O
done O

I O
would O
like O
to O
get O
an O
echocardiogram O
to O
be O
sure O
we O
are O
dealing O
with O
constrictive O
disease O

but O
I O
think O
he O
will O
probably O
need O
to O
have O
a O
cardiac O
catheterization O

I O
would O
like O
to O
get O
the O
echocardiogram O

bring O
him O
in O
for O
cardiac O
catheterization O

and O
see O
if O
there O
are O
narrowings O
either O
in O
the O
graft O
or O
in O
his O
native O
arteries O
that O
may O
be O
contributing O
to O
the O
anterior O
wall O
ischemia O

Starting O
him O
on O
an O
antiarrhythmic O
to O
see O
if O
we O
can O
reestablish O
sinus O
rhythm O
may O
be O
worth O
considering O
or O
perhaps O
cardioversion O
after O
the O
cardiac O
catheterization O

Because O
of O
renal O
insufficiency O

cardiac O
catheterization O
is O
a O
little O
bit O
more O
complicated O
and O
that O
the O
low O
platelets O
are O
also O
an O
issue O
we O
need O
to O
address O

given O
that O
she O
has O
not O
had O
an O
assessment O
of O
her O
ischemic O
burden O

since O
2067 DATE

I O
have O
scheduled O
her O
for O
a O
repeat O

test O
with O

imaging O

If O
this O
is O
similar O
to O
her O
previous O
study O
showing O
only O

fixed O
defects O
and O
no O
reversible O
ischemia O

then O
I O
feel O
that O
she O

will O
be O
of O
low O
to O
moderate O
risk O
for O
surgery O
for O
perioperative O

myocardial O
infarction O
and O
that O
her O
congestive O
heart O
failure O
is O

well O
treated O
and O
therefore O

will O
not O
preclude O
her O
from O
having O

surgery O







Issue O

is O
her O
anticoagulation O
for O
low O

fraction O


She O
is O
currently O
on O
Coumadin O
for O
low O
ejection O

fraction O

As O
far O
as O
I O
know O

she O
has O
never O
had O
atrial O
fibrillation O

and O
she O
has O
never O
been O
told O
that O
she O
had O
an O
irregular O
rate O
or O

rhythm O


Therefore O

I O
recommend O
that O
she O
stop O
her O
Coumadin O
6 O
days O

prior O
to O
surgery O
and O
it O
can O
be O
restarted O
several O
days O
after O

surgery O
without O
Heparin O
overlap O
at O
the O
discretion O
of O
the O
surgeons O

as O
to O
how O
may O
days O
she O
should O
wait O
after O
surgery O
before O

restarting O
that O
medication O


She O
will O
otherwise O
remain O
on O
her O

current O
medical O
regimen O
as O
determined O
by O
her O

This O
is O
scheduled O
for O
next O

and O
Mr O

Jarvis PATIENT
is O
quite O
anxious O
about O
it O






He O
began O
the O
Captopril O

HCTZ O



or O
Maxide O

and O

noted O
good O
blood O

control O
as O
checked O

BH HOSPITAL


At O
first O
he O
developed O
a O
considerable O
cough O
but O
in O
the O
last O
two O
weeks O
this O
has O
largely O
resolved O


He O
states O
that O
the O
cough O
is O
productive O
of O
thick O
phlegm O
and O
may O
reflect O
a O
respiratory O
infection O
rather O
than O
the O
Captopril O
itself O


His O
blood O
sugars O
when O
checked O
at O
home O
have O
averaged O
between O
the O
140 O
to O
150 O
range O

On O
one O
occasion O
a O
three O

or O
gout O
like O
arthritis O
in O
the O
past O
six O
weeks O
and O
is O
quite O
pleased O
about O
this O





He O
has O
continued O

is O
planning O
a O

IMPRESSION O


Doing O
reasonably O
well O
on O
the O
new O
blood O
pressure O
program O


Since O
the O
cough O
is O
resolving O
it O
would O
seem O

We O
will O

Mr O

The O
glucose O
when O
you O
were O
here O
was O
244 O
and O
the O
average O
calclated O
from O
the O
HbA1c O
is O
171 O

despite O
your O
efforts O
and O
exercise O
and O
diet O


I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
wise O
to O
start O
on O
a O
low O
dose O
of O
a O
glucose O
lowering O
medicine O

glipizide O

Glucotrol O



I O
would O
start O
on O
1 O
2 O
of O
a O
5 O
mg O
pill O
twice O
a O
day O
and O
continue O
checking O
your O
blood O
sugar O
levels O
from O
time O
to O
time O


If O
they O
stay O
a O
bit O
up O

then O
increase O
to O
one O
whole O
pill O

5 O
mg O

twice O
a O
day O


Then O
we O
will O
see O
how O
that O
effects O
the O
blood O
sugar O


I O
don O
t O
think O
this O
will O
interfere O
with O
your O
trip O


Call O
me O
in O

tell O

how O

In O
summary O

well O
we O
do O
not O
have O
records O

it O
is O
fairly O
clear O
that O
Mrs O

Preston PATIENT
has O
had O
an O
inferior O
wall O
myocardial O
infarction O
treated O
with O
coronary O
stenting O


She O
did O
receive O
drug O
eluting O
stents O


The O
good O
news O
is O
that O
appears O
that O
her O
left O
ventricular O
function O
is O
very O
well O
preserved O
suggesting O
that O
she O
did O
not O
have O
a O
large O
myocardial O
infarction O


What O
is O
less O
clear O

however O

is O
the O
status O
of O
her O
other O
coronaries O

there O
is O
some O
suggestion O
that O
she O
may O
have O
significant O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
at O
this O
time O



From O
a O
clinical O
standpoint O

I O
certainly O
do O
not O
think O
that O
she O
requires O
a O
cardiac O
catheterization O
at O
this O
time O


She O
is O
fairly O
asymptomatic O

and O
is O
doing O
well O
from O
the O
cardiovascular O
standpoint O


I O
think O
what O
would O
be O
more O
helpful O
in O
guiding O
recommendation O
is O
whether O
she O
has O
significant O
underlying O
ischemia O
at O
this O
point O


To O
this O
end O

I O
have O
arranged O
for O
her O
to O
undergo O
an O
adenosine O
PET O
scan O
to O
assess O
for O
residual O
ischemia O


We O
will O
guide O
our O
recommendations O
regarding O
cardiac O
catheterization O
based O
on O
the O
results O
of O
the O
study O



In O
terms O
of O
her O
lipids O

it O
appears O
that O
she O
has O
been O
switched O
to O
Lipitor O


The O
goal O
for O
her O
LDL O
should O
be O
in O
the O
70s O
and O
her O
HDLs O
ideally O
be O
in O
the O
40s O



In O
terms O
of O
antithrombotic O
therapy O

she O
did O
receive O
drug O
eluting O
stents O


Therefore O

she O
should O
certainly O
remain O
on O
aspirin O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
life O
and O
Plavix O
for O
an O
absolute O
minimum O
of O
one O
year O


After O
a O
year O

it O
would O
likely O
be O
acceptable O
for O
her O
to O
stop O
her O
Plavix O
for O
brief O
periods O
of O
time O
should O
it O
be O
necessary O
for O
other O
medical O
procedures O


However O

up O
until O
that O
time O
her O
Plavix O
should O
not O
be O
discontinued O
without O
a O
discussion O
with O
myself O



She O
is O
on O
a O
very O
good O
medical O
regimen O

although O
I O
think O
she O
would O
benefit O
from O
a O
beta O
blocker O


The O
hydrochlorothiazide O
appears O
to O
be O
a O
new O
medication O
for O
her O

and O
therefore O
I O
went O
ahead O
and O
discontinued O
this O
and O
started O
her O
on O
extended O
release O
metoprolol O
at O
25 O
mg O
a O
day O


This O
can O
certainly O
be O
cut O
uptitrated O
for O
better O
blood O
pressure O
control O



I O
will O
call O
her O
daughter O
Landis PATIENT
with O
the O
results O
of O
her O
PET O
scan O
and O
further O
recommendations O

and O
we O
will O
go O
ahead O
and O
make O
plans O
for O
her O
to O
see O
me O
again O
in O
six O
months O



Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
participate O
in O
her O
care O


If O
you O
have O
any O
further O
questions O
regarding O
her O
management O

do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
contact O

Dear O
Dr O

Barron DOCTOR



I O
would O
like O
to O
give O
you O
followup O
on O
our O
mutual O
patient O
Frances PATIENT
Preston PATIENT


As O
you O
know O

I O
referred O
her O
to O
the O
cardiac O
catheterization O
laboratory O
because O
of O
progressive O
worsening O
angina O
and O
a O
stress O
test O
suggesting O
anterior O
ischemia O


We O
performed O
a O
catheterization O
on O
12 DATE
14 DATE
2076 DATE


We O
utilized O
the O
right O
radial O
artery O
for O
access O


We O
found O
that O
she O
developed O
a O
significant O
in O
stent O
restenosis O
lesion O
within O
the O
previously O
placed O
Cypher O
drug O
eluting O
stent O


This O
is O
undoubtedly O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
symptoms O


We O
were O
able O
to O
treat O
this O
lesion O
with O
balloon O
angioplasty O
and O
ultimately O
stented O
with O
a O
3 O
5 O
x O
24 O
Taxus O
drug O
eluting O
stent O


The O
stent O
was O
postdilated O
with O
a O
4 O
mm O
noncompliant O
balloon O
to O
high O
pressure O


The O
final O
angiographic O
result O
was O
excellent O



The O
following O
morning O
she O
was O
doing O
quite O
well O
and O
we O
discharged O
her O
later O
in O
the O
day O


She O
will O
remain O
on O
her O
usual O
medications O
and O
I O
have O
stressed O
the O
importance O
of O
remaining O
on O
aspirin O
once O
a O
day O
for O
the O
remainder O
of O
her O
life O
and O
Plavix O
for O
a O
minimum O
of O
a O
year O
after O
this O
procedure O

though O
I O
will O
likely O
favor O
indefinite O
therapy O



I O
plan O
on O
seeing O
her O
again O
on O
01 DATE
24 DATE
2077 DATE
in O
followup O


If O
you O
have O
any O
further O
questions O
regarding O
her O
care O

please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
contact O
me O

not O

I O
explained O

again O
in O

She O

I O
don O
t O
think O
the O
moderate O

a O

Her O

her O

that O
her O

I O
told O
her O
that O
it O

I O
suggested O
that O

Mr O

Xuereb PATIENT

in O
follow O

in O
our O
vascular O
surgery O
clinic O
here O
at O
the O
Santa HOSPITAL
Rosa HOSPITAL
Infirmary HOSPITAL
today O


As O
you O
remember O

he O
recently O
underwent O
a O
revision O
of O
his O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
graft O
with O
thrombectomy O
of O
the O
fem O
pop O
bypass O
graft O
and O
subsequent O
jump O
graft O
to O
the O
below O
knee O
popliteal O

He O
returns O
today O
for O
follow O
up O
evaluation O





He O
has O
a O
warm O

well O
perfused O
foot O
with O
a O
palpable O
dorsalis O
pedis O
pulse O


Unfortunately O

over O
the O
last O
ten O
days O
he O
has O
developed O
increased O
erythema O
and O
tenderness O
on O
the O
medial O
aspect O

his O
left O
knee O
with O
superficial O
skin O

consistent O
with O
either O
a O

He O

The O

had O
been O
extremely O
active O
with O
no O

My O

that O
he O

erythema O
on O
the O
medial O

that O
he O
would O
benefit O
from O

Xuereb PATIENT


My O
concern O
is O
that O
if O
he O

this O
PTFE O
graft O
we O
do O
not O
have O
any O
suitable O
autogenous O

and O
he O

stand O
a O

IMPRESSION O
AND O
PLAN O


Mr O

Meyer PATIENT
is O
a O
young O
man O
with O
a O
significant O
and O
quite O
bulky O
prostate O
cancer O


I O
certainly O
do O
not O
think O
active O
surveillance O
is O
an O
option O
for O
him O

which O
is O
a O
shame O

as O
that O
was O
his O
preference O


Left O
untreated O

I O
think O
he O
will O
be O
in O
deep O
trouble O
at O
some O
stage O
over O
the O
next O
few O
years O


His O
second O
choice O
for O
treatment O
is O
prostate O
brachytherapy O
but O
again O
I O
believe O
his O
disease O
is O
too O
extensive O
for O
this O
and O
brachytherapy O
would O
represent O
significant O
under O
treatment O




On O
balance O

my O
preference O
for O
him O
is O
either O
to O
have O
a O
radical O
prostatectomy O

perhaps O
followed O
by O
postoperative O
radiation O
or O
alternatively O

if O
he O
wishes O
to O
avoid O
surgery O
and O
he O
does O

for O
him O
to O
have O
high O
dose O
external O
radiation O
in O
conjunction O
with O
neoadjuvant O
and O
concomitant O
androgen O
deprivation O


While O
I O
think O
he O
will O
recover O
good O
voiding O
function O
after O
either O
of O
these O
treatment O
combinations O
his O
sex O
life O
is O
under O
threat O
and O
he O
is O
aware O
of O
this O


We O
will O
defer O
the O
final O
decision O
next O
week O
until O
he O
has O
had O
his O
scans O


Obviously O

should O
they O
show O
extensive O
extracapsular O
disease O
then O
surgery O
will O
be O
off O
the O
table O

if O
they O
show O
nodal O
disease O
the O
same O
is O
true O
and O
we O
will O
be O
thinking O
in O
terms O
of O
long O
term O
androgen O
deprivation O


Hopefully O
neither O
of O
these O
scenarios O
will O
occur O

Irene PATIENT
Yarbrough PATIENT
for O
evaluation O
of O
her O
atrial O
fibrillation O



Mrs O

Yarbrough PATIENT
is O
55 AGE
years O

Over O
the O

year O
she O
had O
had O
menorrhagia O
and O

underwent O
endometrial O
biopsy O
in O
September DATE
of DATE
2078 DATE
followed O
by O
total O
abdominal O

hysterectomy O
in O
early O
October DATE
of DATE
2078 DATE


Her O
post O
operative O
course O
was O

complicated O
by O
a O
pelvic O
abscess O
for O
which O
she O
was O
rehospitalized O
in O
late O

October DATE
and O
during O
that O
hospitalization O
had O
an O
episode O
of O
atrial O
fibrillation O

which O
reverted O
spontaneously O
to O
sinus O
rhythm O


The O
episode O
was O
accompanied O
by O

some O
substernal O
chest O
heaviness O
but O
no O
other O
symptoms O
and O
she O
was O
not O
aware O
of O

any O

She O
was O
placed O
on O
verapamil O
240 O
mg O

and O
has O
not O

any O

Her O
abdominal O

and O

she O
has O

She O
has O
no O

is O

mildly O
dyspneic O
at O

feels O
that O
her O

capacity O
has O
increased O
somewhat O

that O

period O


She O
probably O

which O
has O

not O

This O
would O
explain O
her O
electrocardiographic O

changes O
and O
the O

as O
well O
as O
the O
possible O
predisposition O
to O

atrial O
fibrillation O


I O
took O
the O
liberty O
of O
switching O
her O
from O
verapamil O
240 O

mg O
daily O
to O
atenolol O
50 O

Once O
her O

we O
will O

arrange O
for O
her O

report O

is O
a O
55 AGE
year O
old O
woman O
who O
presented O

with O
chest O
pain O
which O
was O
epigastric O
and O
substernal O
in O
nature O


essentially O
sharp O
and O
non O
radiating O
that O
had O
come O
on O
at O
rest O


She O

has O
several O
cardiac O
risk O
factors O
including O
hypertension O

obesity O

and O
hormone O
replacement O
but O
had O
no O
specific O
cardiac O
history O


Her O

symptoms O
did O
not O
resolve O
with O
Mylanta O


PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION O


As O
noted O
by O
Dr O

Nettles DOCTOR
and O
is O
most O

noteworthy O
for O
normal O
heart O
sounds O

although O
she O
does O
have O
a O
II O
VI O

systolic O
ejection O
murmur O
at O
the O
apex O

the O
upper O
right O
sternal O

border O



LABORATORY O
EVALUATION O


An O
electrocardiogram O
does O
not O
show O
acute O

changes O
but O
does O
have O
T O
wave O
inversions O
in O
V1 O
to O
V3 O


These O
were O

previously O
noted O
in O
10 DATE
78 DATE


THERAPY O
RENDERED O
COURSE O
IN O
ED O


The O
patient O
required O
nitroglycerine O

and O
nitroglycerine O

IV O
nitroglycerine O
and O
IV O
heparin O
with O
some O

morphine O
to O
relieve O
her O
pain O


She O
also O
received O
Lopressor O
25 O
mg O
IV O

and O
was O
given O
some O
GI O
meds O


She O
eventually O
became O
pain O
free O


although O
she O
does O
admit O
to O
a O
residual O
mild O
discomfort O
in O
her O
chest O


There O
are O
no O
electrocardiographic O
changes O


IMPRESSION O


I O
concur O
with O
Dr O

Nettles DOCTOR
that O
this O
patient O
has O
chest O

pain O
suspicious O
for O
unstable O
angina O


She O
has O
responded O
well O
to O

aggressive O
treatment O
of O
this O
and O
she O
will O
be O
admitted O
for O
further O

evaluation O


FINAL O
DIAGNOSIS O

PHYSICAL O
EXAMINATION O


On O
today O
s O
examination O

the O
patient O
was O
noted O
to O
have O
a O
fairly O
long O
carpal O
tunnel O
scar O
on O
bilateral O
hands O
extending O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
volar O
wrist O
level O


Long O
finger O
and O
right O
index O
finger O
scar O
at O
the O
base O
at O
the O
MP O
joint O
level O
is O
noted O

the O
fourth O
trigger O
release O

which O
was O
performed O
in O
2062 DATE
as O
well O


The O
patient O
has O
rather O
stiff O
fingers O
overall O
with O
inability O
to O
fully O
flex O
the O
fingers O
all O
the O
way O
to O
the O
thumb O
space O


There O
is O
no O
locking O
or O
triggering O

but O
fairly O
extensive O
stiffness O
involving O
the O
flexor O
tendon O
was O
noted O


Durkan O
s O
test O
was O
positive O
and O
Phalen O
s O
test O
was O
positive O
as O
well O


However O

abductor O
pollicis O
brevis O
function O
is O
intact O


Other O
examination O
demonstrated O
some O
noticeable O
decrease O
in O
size O
of O
the O
muscle O
with O
some O
prominence O
of O
the O
vasculature O
on O
the O
radial O
side O
of O
the O
left O
hand O

but O
otherwise O
normal O
examination O


IMPRESSION O


As O
above O


PLAN O


My O
recommendation O
is O
that O
patient O
undergo O
very O
vigorous O
assessment O
for O
the O
median O
nerve O
function O


In O
addition O
to O
this O

I O
would O
like O
to O
actually O
consider O
providing O
him O
with O
the O
stretching O
exercises O
and O
flexion O
exercises O
as O
well O
as O
passive O
range O
of O
motion O
of O
the O
fingers O


It O
may O
be O
a O
little O
to O
early O
to O
consider O
this O
option O
until O
he O
returns O
with O
the O
result O

she O

she O

Later O

the O

she O
stated O
that O
her O
blood O
pressure O

high O
for O
the O
last O
several O

She O
was O
still O
complaining O
of O
slightly O
dizziness O
and O
low O

The O
skin O
is O
warm O

dry O
and O
she O
looks O

She O
is O

The O

The O

Impression O


Mrs O

Foust PATIENT
is O
feeling O
much O
improved O


The O
dizziness O
and O
low O
back O
discomfort O
that O
she O
describes O
could O
possibly O
be O
associated O
with O
a O
drop O
in O
blood O
pressure O
to O
170 O
mmHg O

with O
mild O
hypoperfusion O
of O
her O
spinal O
arteries O

as O
well O
as O
her O
head O


However O

today O
she O
had O
dizziness O
even O
with O
a O
blood O
pressure O
of O
160 O
mmHg O


Though O
we O
could O
be O
tempted O
to O
juggle O
with O
her O
regimen O
and O
reduce O
her O
amlodipine O
slightly O

or O
change O
the O
times O
when O
she O
takes O
the O
medications O

I O
think O
that O
we O
are O
facing O
some O
difficulties O
only O
related O
to O
the O
poor O
autoregulation O
of O
her O
cerebral O
and O
peripheral O
vessels O


I O
think O
that O
we O
should O
continue O
her O
on O
her O
present O
regimen O


Gradually O

we O
would O
expect O
her O
symptoms O

related O
to O
changes O
in O
blood O
pressure O

to O
improve O
as O
her O
vessel O
elasticity O
improves O


I O
think O
that O
we O
can O
be O
satisfied O
that O
she O
is O
not O
becoming O
too O
bradycardic O


We O
are O
pleased O
with O
the O
present O
regimen O


We O
have O
never O
been O
absolutely O
certain O
that O
there O
has O
been O
no O
tiny O
penetrating O
aortic O
ulcer O
for O
her O
discomforts O
or O
so O
dramatic O

but O
the O
treatment O
would O
be O
precisely O
as O
it O
is O
now O


We O
were O
not O
surprised O
by O
her O
CTA O
and O
her O
treatment O

naturally O

remains O
unchanged O


I O
think O
that O
we O
want O
her O
to O
continue O
her O
metformin O

and O
we O
may O
have O
to O
consider O
increasing O
it O
to O
at O
least O
twice O
daily O

depending O
on O
followup O
A1c O
values O





Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
assist O
in O
Mrs O

Foust PATIENT
s O
care O


I O
know O
that O
you O
will O
continue O
to O
follow O
her O
closely O


I O
told O
her O
that O
I O
would O
see O
her O
again O
in O
nine O
months O

History O
of O
Present O
Illness O


Mr O

Sherman PATIENT
is O
a O
patient O
well O
known O
to O

me O


I O
have O
seen O
him O
on O
multiple O
occasions O
for O
his O
coronary O
artery O

disease O

hypertension O

and O
diabetes O


The O
patient O
has O
had O
a O
positive O

exercise O
tolerance O
test O
recently O
and O
was O
seen O
by O
Cardiology O
who O
felt O

that O
he O
should O
undergo O
cardiac O
catheterization O


However O

patient O
was O

overweight O
and O
the O
decision O
was O
made O
for O
him O
to O
reduce O
his O
weight O
by O

approximately O
50 O
lb O

at O
which O
time O
he O
would O
be O
suitable O
for O
cardiac O

catheterization O
on O
the O
Pontiac HOSPITAL
equipment O


Patient O
was O
seen O
last O
night O

in O
the O
Pontiac HOSPITAL
Emergency O
Room O
with O
a O
several O
day O
history O
of O
back O
pain O

which O
began O
in O
the O
middle O
of O
his O
back O
and O
has O
subsequently O
become O
right O

flank O
pain O
which O
is O
persistent O
and O
colicky O
in O
nature O





On O
exam O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Room O
he O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
afebrile O


His O
exam O
was O

notable O
for O
CVA O
tenderness O
and O
an O
exam O
highly O
suspicious O
of O
renal O
colic O



His O
EKG O
was O
unremarkable O
and O
his O
laboratory O
exam O
was O
unremarkable O
as O

well O


His O
urinalysis O
did O
not O
demonstrate O
any O
red O
blood O
cells O

however O


did O
have O
3 O

uric O
acid O
crystals O
with O
a O
normal O
uric O
acid O
blood O
level O


An O

abdominal O
ultrasound O
was O
ordered O
which O
was O
unremarkable O
except O
for O
the O

presence O
of O
his O
slight O
abnormality O
in O
the O
right O
pole O
of O
a O
kidney O


IVP O

was O
recommended O
by O
the O
radiologist O
for O
follow O
up O


He O
was O
given O
Toradol O

in O
the O
Emergency O
Room O
with O
minimal O
improvement O
and O
sent O
home O
with O
some O

Motrin O
with O
the O
follow O
up O
to O
be O
by O
me O
in O
Internal O
Medicine O
Clinic O


I O
was O
called O
by O

the O
patient O
this O
morning O
complaining O
of O
worsening O
pain O
in O
his O
right O

flank O


On O
it O

patient O
states O
he O
is O
unable O
to O
get O
out O
of O
bed O
and O
was O

brought O
to O
the O
Pontiac HOSPITAL
State HOSPITAL
Hospital HOSPITAL
to O
my O
Internal O
Medicine O
Clinic O


On O
exam O

he O
was O
afebrile O
and O
his O
exam O
was O
notable O
for O
a O
right O
CVA O
tenderness O
with O

pain O
radiating O
around O
to O
his O
abdomen O
and O
exacerbated O
by O
pushing O
on O
his O

abdomen O


Patient O
has O
good O
bowel O
sounds O
throughout O
and O
there O
are O
no O

peritoneal O
signs O



Assessment O
and O
Plan O


While O
I O
am O
concerned O
about O
his O
possible O
renal O

pathology O
I O
believe O
that O
there O
is O
a O
significant O
chance O
that O
this O
may O
be O

musculoskeletal O
in O
nature O

however O

due O
to O
his O
other O
medical O
problems O
I O

feel O
that O
an O
intravenous O
pyelogram O
is O
definitely O
indicated O
and O
he O
will O

undergo O
this O
study O
this O
afternoon O


I O
have O
also O
sent O
off O
a O
repeat O
CBC O

with O
differential O

a O
repeat O
urinalysis O
and O
amylase O
and O
lipase O
levels O
to O

rule O
out O
pancreatitis O


Of O
note O

patient O
does O
have O
a O
history O
of O
peptic O

ulcer O
disease O

however O

he O
was O
guaiac O
negative O
in O
the O
Emergency O
Room O
and O

reports O
no O
episodes O
of O
hematemesis O

hematochezia O

or O
melena O


He O
is O
also O

status O
post O
cholecystectomy O


I O
will O
review O
his O
IVP O
later O
today O
and O
make O

further O
therapeutic O
interventions O
at O
that O
time O

Dear O
Dr O

Short DOCTOR


I O
did O
see O
Irene PATIENT
Upshur PATIENT
for O
a O
followup O
today O


As O
you O
know O

I O
did O
see O
her O
back O
in O
September DATE
where O
she O
was O
diagnosed O
with O
possible O
right O
sided O
eustachian O
tube O
dysfunction O


Her O
blood O
sugars O
have O
been O
under O
reasonably O
good O
control O

88 O
and O
then O
300 O


She O
reports O
that O
her O
hearing O
has O
continued O
to O
fluctuate O


When O
questioned O

she O
reports O
that O
she O
only O
used O
the O
nose O
spray O
twice O
since O
I O
did O
prescribe O
it O


On O
examination O
today O

she O
otherwise O
appears O
well O


Ears O
are O
unremarkable O


Her O
eardrums O
are O
intact O


She O
has O
no O
tympanosclerosis O
or O
cholesteatoma O


Her O
gait O
is O
normal O


There O
is O
no O
nystagmus O


An O
audiogram O
done O
today O
does O
show O
a O
sloping O
high O
frequency O
sensorineural O
hearing O
loss O

which O
is O
symmetric O


Her O
discrimination O
scores O
are O
100 O

in O
the O
right O
ear O
and O
100 O

in O
the O
left O
ear O


Assessment O


Mild O
ear O
fullness O
with O
dysequilibrium O
and O
blockage O


Plan O


She O
does O
take O
multiple O
medications O


It O
continues O
to O
be O
very O
unclear O
to O
me O
what O
her O
underlying O
causality O
is O


I O
would O
like O
her O
to O
use O
the O
nasal O
spray O
more O
consistently O


If O
she O
does O
fail O
this O
and O
this O
is O
not O
eustachian O
tube O
dysfunction O

I O
would O
consider O
her O
to O
have O
endolymphatic O
hydrops O


This O
would O
respond O
hopefully O
to O
a O
diuretic O
and O
potassium O
supplementation O


However O

she O
has O
taken O
multiple O
medications O
currently O
for O
both O
blood O
pressure O
including O
atenolol O

Cozaar O

Lasix O

and O
verapamil O


I O
would O
need O
to O
clear O
to O
switch O
herself O









therapy O

I O
would O
like O
to O
see O
her O
back O
after O
consistent O
trial O
of O
the O
corticosteroid O
spray O
topically O


Sincerely O

Dear O
Dr O

Pacheco DOCTOR





I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
your O
patient O

Donn PATIENT
Emery PATIENT

in O
the O
Internal O
Medicine O
recently O

Thank O
you O
for O
your O
kind O
referral O

I O
will O
summarize O
his O
history O
and O
physical O
examination O
for O
my O
own O
records O





Mr O

Emery PATIENT
is O
a O
86 AGE
year O
old O
right O
handed O
gentleman O
who O
is O
referred O
with O
complaint O
and O
electrophysiologic O
findings O
consistent O
with O
a O
generalized O
sensory O
motor O
polyneuropathy O

His O
symptoms O
began O
a O
number O
of O
years O
ago O
when O
he O
noticed O
bilateral O
loss O
of O
sensation O
at O
the O
tips O
of O
his O
fingers O
in O
the O
hands O

This O
had O
extended O
over O
several O
months O
to O
include O
his O
feet O
as O
well O

Over O
many O
months O
to O
years O
he O
has O
noticed O
a O
weakness O
of O
his O
grip O
bilaterally O

which O
over O
the O
more O
recent O
period O
of O
time O
encompassing O
the O
last O
year O
has O
been O
worse O
on O
the O
left O

At O
one O
time O
that O
grip O
weakness O
was O
ascribed O
to O
possible O
carpal O
tunnel O
syndrome O
and O
he O
underwent O
a O
right O
carpal O
tunnel O
release O
on O
the O
right O
approximately O
four O
years O
ago O

Three O
weeks O
ago O
he O
underwent O
a O
left O
carpal O
tunnel O
release O
for O
these O
same O
symptoms O

He O
has O
had O
no O
falls O

but O
does O
note O
some O
unsteadiness O
on O
his O
feet O

He O
has O
had O
no O
sensations O
of O
tingling O
or O
loss O
of O
sensory O
stimulus O
around O
his O
face O

He O
has O
had O
no O
diplopia O

dysarthria O

dysphagia O

or O
bowel O
or O
bladder O
complaints O
that O
might O
be O
related O
to O

neurologic O
problems O

He O
has O
occasional O
shortness O
of O
breath O
on O
exertion O

Otherwise O

the O
remainder O
of O
his O
medical O
and O
neurologic O
review O
of O
systems O
is O
unremarkable O





Past O
medical O
history O
is O
significant O
for O
a O
past O
episode O
of O
urethral O
stones O

history O
of O
lymphoma O
of O
unclear O
type O
by O
the O
medical O
record O
but O
would O
appear O
to O
be O
non O
Hodgkins O

He O
is O
undergoing O
extensive O
surveillance O
on O
a O
yearly O
basis O
for O
recurrence O

He O
has O
a O
history O
of O
prostate O
hypertrophy O

hypertension O

and O
longstanding O
history O
of O
noninsulin O
dependent O
diabetes O
since O
the O
age O
of O
50 AGE

His O
glucose O
control O
by O
his O
history O
has O
been O
very O
good O

He O
has O
lumbar O
back O

Current O
medications O
include O
aspirin O

Cozaar O

clopamide O

Triamterene O

Tenormin O

and O
Glucophage O





He O
has O
no O

allergies O





He O
does O
not O
smoke O

uses O
alcohol O
socially O

lives O
in O
Juneau CITY
South CITY

has O
no O
obvious O
toxin O
exposure O
to O
heavy O
metals O





His O
family O
history O
is O
negative O
for O
obvious O
neuromuscular O
disease O


He O
had O
a O
brother O
who O
died O
in O
his O
50s AGE
of O
some O
sort O
of O
brain O
infection O

He O
has O
several O
children O

all O
in O
good O
health O




On O
my O
examination O
today O

he O
is O
alert O
and O
well O
appearing O

with O
good O
concentration O

memory O

and O
language O
function O

No O
carotid O
bruits O
could O
be O
appreciated O

The O
peripheral O
vascular O
examination O
revealed O
weak O
pulses O
in O
all O
four O
limbs O





He O
had O
full O
extraocular O
motility O

with O
normal O
visual O
fields O
bilaterally O

Funduscopy O
was O
normal O
bilaterally O

Pupillary O
reflexes O
were O
intact O
to O
both O
light O
and O
near O
stimulation O


The O
muscles O
of O
facial O
expression O

mastication O

and O
the O
lower O
bulbar O
musculature O
were O
intact O
bilaterally O


Facial O
sensation O
was O
intact O
bilaterally O
to O
light O
touch O





On O
motor O
examination O

occasional O
fasciculations O
were O
seen O
throughout O

There O
was O
clear O
wasting O
of O
the O
intrinsic O
muscles O
of O
the O
hands O
bilaterally O

and O
trace O
weakness O
at O
IV O

V O
by O
MRC O
criteria O
in O
a O
symmetric O
distribution O
of O
the O
hands O
bilaterally O


Otherwise O

muscles O
of O
the O
proximal O
shoulder O
girdle O

forearm O

and O
upper O
arm O
were O
V O
V O
bilaterally O

In O
the O
lower O
extremities O

again O

distal O
muscle O
wasting O
was O
noted O

although O
power O
in O
all O
muscle O
groups O
was O
full O





Sensation O
testing O
revealed O
a O
moderate O
to O
severe O
deficit O
in O
vibratory O
and O
joint O
position O
sense O
distally O
in O
the O
lower O
extremities O

Temperature O

pinprick O
and O
light O
touch O
sensation O
appeared O
to O
be O
intact O





There O
was O
no O
dysmetria O
on O
finger O
nose O
finger O
testing O

and O
gait O
was O
not O
ataxic O

Romberg O
was O
slightly O
positive O
with O
sway O
but O
no O
fall O





Deep O
tendon O
reflexes O
were O
hyporeflexic O
throughout O

Specifically O
I O

reflexes O
were O
elicited O
in O
the O
patellar O
tendons O
in O
a O
symmetric O
distribution O

trace O
ankle O
jerks O
were O
elicited O

and O
I O

reflexes O
were O
elicited O
in O
the O
biceps O

triceps O

and O
brachioradialis O

There O
was O
no O
jaw O
jerk O

Toes O
were O
downgoing O
bilaterally O





Mr O

Emery PATIENT
has O
already O
undergone O
EMG O
nerve O
conduction O
study O
recently O
at O
this O
institution O

Those O
results O
were O
available O
for O
me O
today O

They O
are O
consistent O
with O
a O
generalized O
axonal O
sensory O
motor O
polyneuropathy O

which O
is O
moderate O
in O
distal O
extremities O


Both O
active O
and O
chronic O
denervation O
changes O
are O
seen O
on O
the O
EMG O


There O
is O
no O
evidence O
for O
demyelinating O
phenotype O

and O
nerve O
conduction O
does O
reveal O
a O
conduction O
block O
at O
common O
sites O
of O
compression O
of O
the O
median O
nerve O
in O
the O
wrist O

consistent O
with O
carpal O
tunnel O
syndrome O





Given O
the O
apparent O
chronic O
nature O
of O
Mr O

Emery PATIENT
s O
complaints O

an O
axonal O
sensory O
motor O
neuropathy O
most O
likely O
idiopathic O
in O
origin O

or O
more O
probably O
related O
to O
the O
diabetes O
is O
the O
likely O
diagnosis O


With O
respect O
to O
the O
weakness O
in O
the O
hands O

which O
appears O
to O
encompass O
more O
muscle O
groups O
than O
would O
be O
accounted O
for O
by O
a O
median O
nerve O
compression O
at O
the O
wrist O

this O
is O
likely O
the O
consequence O
of O
this O
longstanding O
axonal O
degeneration O

There O
is O
no O
abnormality O
on O
the O
history O

examination O

or O
current O
electrophysiology O
that O
would O
lead O
me O
to O
suspect O
this O
is O
anything O
more O
unusual O

In O
addition O
to O
the O
diabetes O

of O
course O
the O
primary O
concern O
would O
be O
lymphoma O
related O
neuropathy O

either O
related O
to O
direct O
lymphomatous O
invasion O
of O
the O
perineurium O

or O
more O

often O
as O
a O
perineoplastic O
phenomenon O

The O
very O
chronic O
nature O
of O
his O
symptoms O
would O
argue O
against O
this O
as O
a O
likely O
etiology O

and O
he O
is O

of O
course O

undergoing O
extensive O
surveillance O
for O
such O
a O
recurrence O

I O
would O
not O
think O
that O
his O
current O
symptomatology O
would O
be O
any O
cause O
for O
greater O
concern O
regarding O
new O
recurrence O
of O

his O
illness O





Unfortunately O

as O
you O
know O

we O
are O
not O
able O
to O
offer O
anything O
in O
the O
way O
of O
therapy O
for O
this O
at O
this O
time O

We O
can O
certainly O
treat O
any O
positive O
symptoms O
of O
painful O
dysesthesias O
fairly O
effectively O
with O
antineuropathic O
pain O
medications O
such O
as O
Amitriptyline O

Gabapentin O

or O
sodium O
channel O
agents O
such O
as O
phenytoin O
or O








However O

this O
is O
not O
a O
prominent O
complaint O
of O
Mr O

Emery PATIENT
s O
and O
this O
is O
not O
likely O
to O
be O
helpful O
for O
him O

Nevertheless O

there O
may O
be O
other O
therapies O
in O
the O
near O
future O
that O
might O
be O
available O
for O
this O
type O
of O
problem O

I O
will O
be O
happy O
to O
continue O
to O
see O
Mr O


Emery PATIENT
on O
a O
roughly O
yearly O
basis O

so O
that O
he O
can O
keep O
in O
touch O
and O
be O
made O
aware O
of O
any O
therapy O
that O
might O
be O
helpful O
and O
available O
for O
him O
in O
the O
future O





If O
you O
have O
any O
questions O
please O
do O
not O
hesitate O
to O
call O
me O

Once O
again O

thank O
you O

Overall O

Mr O

Dejesus PATIENT
is O
a O
pleasant O
78 AGE
year O
old O
man O
with O
a O
complex O
prior O
medical O
history O
who O
appears O
to O
have O
persistent O
atrial O
fibrillation O
with O
a O
principal O
functional O
limitation O
of O
exertional O
shortness O
of O
breath O


He O
appears O
to O
be O
functional O
class O
III O


He O
does O
not O
have O
any O
frank O
evidence O
of O
volume O
overload O
on O
exam O
today O

though O
his O
ventricular O
function O
and O
is O
not O
entirely O
normal O


Moreover O

he O
has O
multiple O
comorbidities O
which O
may O
exacerbate O
his O
exertional O
dyspnea O
including O
COPD O
and O
coronary O
artery O
disease O




We O
discussed O
atrial O
fibrillation O
with O
Mr O

Dejesus PATIENT
and O
his O
family O
today O


We O
explained O
that O
the O
brief O
period O
of O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
associated O
with O
symptomatic O
improvement O
may O
be O
a O
reason O
to O
proceed O
with O
catheter O
ablation O


However O

given O
his O
comorbidities O
and O
the O
presence O
of O
persistent O
arrhythmia O
we O
warned O
that O
a O
single O
catheter O
ablation O
procedure O
may O
not O
be O
entirely O
successful O
and O
that O
waiting O
period O
of O
approximately O
3 O
4 O
month O
post O
ablation O
may O
be O
required O
to O
adjudicate O
success O


Given O
the O
length O
of O
the O
procedure O
as O
well O
as O
his O
comorbidities O

we O
feel O
reasonable O
to O
consult O
with O
our O
anesthesia O
colleagues O
for O
possible O
consideration O
of O
performing O
the O
procedure O
under O
general O
anesthesia O
versus O
with O
MAC O
and O
had O
procedural O
sedation O


We O
will O
leave O
this O
decision O
to O
them O


Moreover O

prior O
to O
the O
ablation O

we O
will O
request O
a O
transesophageal O
echocardiogram O
to O
rule O
out O
left O
atrial O
clot O
prior O
to O
ablation O




Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
referring O
Mr O

Dejesus PATIENT
to O
our O
care O


We O
will O
be O
in O
touch O
following O
the O
procedure O


As O
always O

feel O
free O
to O
call O
with O
any O
questions O

ADDENDUM O


In O
reviewing O
patient O
s O
medical O
records O
after O
he O
left O
today O

I O
found O
mention O
of O
both O
hematuria O
and O
guaiac O
positive O
stool O
during O
his O
recent O
hospitalizations O


At O
this O
time O

he O
was O
quite O
debilitated O
and O
I O
do O
not O
think O
it O
would O
be O
a O
good O
time O
for O
colonoscopy O


He O
did O
deny O
abdominal O
symptoms O
as O
part O
of O
my O
review O
of O
systems O
today O




At O
this O
point O

my O
plan O
will O
be O
to O
send O
him O
some O
stool O
guaiac O
cards O
which O
he O
can O
do O
at O
home O
and O
send O
in O
to O
me O
by O
mail O


I O
have O
also O
sent O
off O
a O
CBC O
today O


I O
will O
plan O
to O
repeat O
urinalysis O
at O
his O
next O
visit O


If O
he O
has O
persistent O
hematuria O
or O
guaiac O
positive O
stool O

then O
we O
will O
need O
to O
discuss O
more O
aggressive O
work O
up O

but O
given O
his O
overall O
health O
condition O

I O
do O
not O
feel O
the O
need O
to O
be O
aggressive O
at O
this O
time O
and O
would O
like O
to O
see O
him O
get O
some O
strength O

Dear O
Dr O

Kirk DOCTOR





I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
your O
patient O

Christopher PATIENT
Parrish PATIENT

in O
follow O
up O
today O


He O
is O
a O
71 AGE
year O
old O

right O
handed O
man O
who O
was O
admitted O
to O
the O
Sutton HOSPITAL
Family HOSPITAL
Care HOSPITAL
on O
December DATE
29 DATE

2088 DATE
with O
left O
arm O
weakness O

ataxia O
and O
dysarthria O


The O
impression O
at O
that O
time O
was O
for O
lacunar O
stroke O


An O
MRI O
showed O
a O
larger O
area O
of O
infarct O
in O
the O
right O
corona O
radiata O


The O
patient O
had O
worsening O
weakness O
on O
the O
night O
of O
admission O

despite O
being O
heparinized O


The O
following O
day O

he O
had O
a O
flaccid O
hemiparesis O
of O
the O
left O
side O


Further O
workup O
included O
a O
magnetic O
resonance O
angiogram O
that O
showed O
irregularity O
of O
the O
proximal O
middle O
cerebral O
arteries O
bilaterally O


There O
was O
no O
critical O
carotid O
stenosis O


He O
had O
an O
embolic O
workup O
which O
consisted O
of O
an O
echocardiogram O
showing O
a O
preserved O
ejection O
fraction O

dilated O
left O
atrium O

very O
mild O
inferior O
hypokinesis O

and O
no O
patent O
foramen O
ovale O


He O
had O
a O
Holter O
monitor O
which O
did O
not O
reveal O
any O
dysrhythmias O


His O
cholesterol O
level O
was O
152 O
with O
an O
HDL O
of O
23 O


It O
was O
felt O
that O
his O
stroke O
was O
most O
likely O
due O
to O
atherosclerosis O
of O
the O
middle O
cerebral O
artery O

involving O
either O
one O
or O
possibly O
several O
lenticulostriate O
arteries O


He O
did O
not O
have O
any O
evidence O
of O
a O
flow O
limiting O
MCA O
stenosis O


He O
had O
been O
on O
aspirin O
prior O

Plavix O
was O
added O
to O
his O
regimen O






Since O
his O
discharge O
from O
the O
hospital O

he O
has O
been O
in O
rehabilitation O
for O
the O
last O
two O
months O


He O
has O
had O
no O
further O
episodes O
of O
weakness O

numbness O

tingling O

ataxia O

dysarthria O

or O
dysphagia O


He O
has O
no O
symptoms O
of O
aphasia O


He O
has O
been O
left O
with O
some O
dysarthria O
from O
his O
initial O
event O

which O
he O
feels O
has O
improved O


I O
would O
agree O
with O
him O


He O
also O
has O
regained O
some O
strength O
in O
the O
left O
leg O

and O
is O
currently O
working O
on O
using O
a O
walker O
with O
assistance O


Unfortunately O

he O
has O
not O
regained O
any O
use O
of O
the O
left O
arm O


He O
has O
not O
had O
any O
problems O
with O
spasms O






His O
past O
medical O
history O
is O
significant O
for O
hypertension O
and O
type O
II O
diabetes O

He O
had O
an O
inferior O
myocardial O
infarction O
in O
2060 DATE


He O
had O
a O
quadruple O
bypass O
in O
2083 DATE


His O

quit O

There O

at O

but O
no O

history O
of O

On O
examination O

he O
was O
a O
pleasant O
gentleman O
in O
no O
apparent O
distress O


His O
blood O
pressure O
was O
150 O
90 O


His O
language O
was O
intact O


His O
speech O
was O
somewhat O
dysarthric O

although O
this O
was O
improved O
from O
his O
admission O


He O
was O
alert O
and O
oriented O


His O
conversation O
was O
appropriate O


The O
visual O
fields O
were O
full O


The O
pupils O
were O
equal O
and O
reactive O
at O

Facial O
sensation O
was O
normal O


There O
was O
an O

left O
facial O

The O
tongue O
and O

were O

The O
patient O
had O
0 O

flaccid O
hemiplegia O
of O
the O
left O
arm O


There O
was O
atrophy O
of O
the O

There O
was O

He O

an O

His O

I O
could O
not O

any O

He O

Mr O

Parrish PATIENT
s O
recovery O
is O
progressing O


He O
has O
regained O
some O
strength O
in O
his O
left O
leg O
and O
his O
goal O
is O
to O
be O
able O
to O
walk O
on O
his O
own O
with O
either O
a O
cane O
or O
walker O


I O
hope O
that O
this O
will O
be O
the O
case O


Unfortunately O

his O
left O
arm O
has O
remained O
flaccid O
and O
he O
has O
no O
movement O


I O
told O
him O
that O
his O
left O
arm O
will O
most O
likely O
remain O
with O
severe O
weakness O


His O
stroke O
was O
most O
likely O
related O
to O
atheroma O
of O
the O
middle O
cerebral O
artery O
and O
lenticulostriate O
arteries O


I O
would O
encourage O
his O
blood O
pressure O
to O
be O
controlled O

as O
has O
been O
done O

and O
to O
continue O
an O
anticholesterol O
agent O


I O
believe O
he O
has O
been O
on O
Gemfibrozil O
for O
a O
while O


The O
literature O
suggests O
benefit O
for O
the O
statin O
drugs O
in O
primary O
prevention O
of O
stroke O
in O
patients O
with O
elevated O
cholesterol O


I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
gemfibrozil O
has O
been O
studied O
in O
the O
same O
way O


However O

since O
he O
has O
been O
on O
this O
medicine O
so O
long O

it O
may O
be O
worthwhile O
to O
continue O
using O
it O
if O
it O
is O
controlling O
his O
total O
cholesterol O
well O


He O
should O
continue O
on O
an O
aspirin O
a O
day O


He O
states O
that O
he O
is O
having O
difficulty O
obtaining O
Plavix O
due O
to O
the O
cost O


I O
recommended O
to O
him O
that O

in O
the O
experience O
of O
the O
Stroke O
Service O
at O
Sutton HOSPITAL
Family HOSPITAL
Care HOSPITAL

patients O
in O
his O
situation O
do O
benefit O
from O
being O
on O
Plavix O
for O
a O
period O
of O
time O
after O
a O
stroke O
of O
this O
type O


We O
recommended O
to O
him O
that O
he O
continue O
on O
Plavix O
for O
another O
six O
months O
because O
of O
this O



This O
should O
give O
adequate O
time O
for O
any O
ulcerated O
or O
unstable O
plaque O
in O
his O
middle O
cerebral O
artery O
to O
heal O


After O
six O
months O

if O
he O
has O
had O
no O
further O
clinical O
events O

it O
would O
be O
reasonable O
to O
assume O
that O
his O
atheroma O
is O
stable O
and O
that O
he O
could O
be O
adequately O
treated O
with O
aspirin O


I O
will O
see O
him O
again O
in O
clinic O
in O
approximately O
six O
months O


I O
will O
arrange O
for O
carotid O
noninvasives O
and O
anterior O
transcranial O
Dopplers O
to O
evaluate O
his O
carotid O
and O
middle O
cerebral O
artery O
in O
approximately O
one O

By O
the O

That O

he O

The O
next O

he O
underwent O

Mr O

Urban PATIENT
underwent O
a O
exercise O
treadmill O
test O

yesterday O


He O
exercised O
for O
10 O

achieving O
a O
maximum O
workload O
of O
12 O
METS O

and O
a O

His O
electrocardiogram O
was O
negative O

revealed O
a O
mild O
reduction O
in O
tracer O
activity O
in O
the O

persisted O

was O
no O
evidence O
of O
ischemia O
elsewhere O


His O
left O
ventricular O
ejection O
fraction O
was O
measured O
at O
51 O





In O
short O

Mr O

Urban PATIENT
is O
a O
51 AGE
year O
old O
who O
had O
an O
inferior O
myocardial O
infarction O

but O
interestingly O
during O
his O
hospitalization O
had O
systolic O
dysfunction O
well O
out O
of O
proportion O
to O
his O
coronary O
disease O


Also O

his O
systolic O
function O
has O
improved O
over O
time O


I O
think O
there O
are O
two O
processes O
going O
on O


One O
is O
coronary O
artery O
disease O


Clearly O
this O
has O
manifested O
itself O
as O
an O
inferior O
myocardial O
infarction O
due O
to O
an O
occluded O
right O
coronary O
artery O

which O
was O
treated O
during O
his O
hospitalization O
with O
stenting O


The O
other O
issue O
is O
his O
transient O
systolic O
dysfunction O
that O
is O
out O
of O
proportion O
to O
his O
coronary O
artery O
disease O


Given O
the O
rapid O
improvement O
in O
his O
ejection O
fraction O

I O
can O
only O
speculate O
as O
to O
the O
etiology O
of O
this O


He O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
have O
a O
persistent O
cardiomyopathy O

but O
a O
transient O
one O


I O
suspect O
that O
this O
is O
myocarditis O


Unfortunatley O

I O
have O
no O
way O
of O
proving O
this O
for O
certain O
but O
clinically O
it O
seems O
to O
fit O


It O
is O
possible O
that O
whatever O
led O
to O
his O
myocarditis O
also O
triggered O
his O
acute O
coronary O
syndrome O






From O
the O
aspect O
of O
his O
coronary O
artery O
disease O

he O
will O
continue O
on O
aspirin O
for O
life O


He O
received O
quite O
a O
substantial O
amount O
of O
stenting O
to O
his O
right O
coronary O
artery O

and O
I O
would O
opt O
to O
continue O
his O
Plavix O
for O
at O
least O
12 O
months O


For O
his O
hyperlipidemia O

I O
agree O
with O
Lipitor O

and O
we O
will O
recheck O
his O
lipid O
profile O
to O
see O
if O
the O
dose O
of O
Lipitor O
is O
adequate O


His O
LDL O
goal O
will O
be O
less O
than O
100 O


He O
is O
well O
beta O
blocked O
on O
his O
carvedilol O

and O
we O
will O
continue O
with O
the O
current O
dose O
of O
6 O
25 O
mg O
twice O
daily O


His O
blood O
pressure O
allows O
us O
to O
increase O
his O
lisinopril O
from O
10 O
to O
15 O
mg O
daily O


I O
will O
see O
Mr O

Urban PATIENT
again O
in O
three O
months O
for O
followup O


I O
will O
repeat O
his O
echocardiogram O
in O
six O
months O

time O
to O
see O
where O
his O
ejection O
fraction O
has O
settled O
out O




Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
participate O
in O
the O
care O
of O
this O
very O
interesting O

pleasant O

Impression O


This O
is O
a O
50 AGE
year O
old O
man O
with O
coronary O
disease O
who O
suffered O
an O
inferoposterior O
myocardial O
infarction O
in O
July DATE
2093 DATE


Additionally O

he O
was O
also O
found O
to O
have O
cardiomyopathy O
with O
an O
LV O
ejection O
fraction O
of O
37 O
percent O


He O
is O
currently O
asymptomatic O
from O
his O
coronary O
disease O
and O
his O
LV O
dysfunction O


Notably O

his O
last O
echocardiogram O
shows O
that O
he O
has O
increased O
RV O
systolic O
pressure O
and O
some O
early O
right O
ventricular O
dysfunction O


The O
etiology O
of O
this O
right O
ventricular O
dysfunction O
is O
not O
clear O


There O
is O
likely O
a O
component O
of O
left O
heart O
failure O


In O
addition O

he O
may O
have O
right O
heart O
failure O
out O
of O
proportion O
to O
left O
heart O
failure O

he O
has O
a O
longstanding O
smoking O
history O
and O
may O
have O
a O
degree O
of O
COPD O
and O

lastly O

he O
may O
have O
obstructive O
sleep O
apnea O


He O
reports O
to O
me O
that O
he O
does O
snore O
at O
night O

and O
his O
first O
wife O
in O
Georgia COUNTRY
had O
told O
him O
for O
many O
years O
that O
during O
the O
night O
he O
had O
periods O
were O
he O
would O
stop O
breathing O


This O
raises O
obstructive O
sleep O
apnea O
as O
a O
consideration O






Recommendations O

Initially O

I O
am O
going O
to O
start O
him O
on O
Lasix O
20 O
mg O
daily O
to O
lower O
his O
preload O
to O
help O
with O
any O
component O
of O
LV O
failure O
that O
is O
leading O
to O
this O


The O
rest O
of O
his O
regimen O
is O
quite O
good O

and O
I O
intend O
to O
continue O
them O


To O
help O
to O
see O
if O
there O
is O
any O
component O
of O
cor O
pulmonale O
that O
may O
be O
contributing O
to O
this O

I O
am O
going O
to O
obtain O
first O
a O
chest O
x O
ray O

secondly O
a O
pulmonary O
function O
testing O

and O
lastly O
a O
sleep O
study O


If O
indeed O
we O
find O
components O
of O
obstructive O
lung O
disease O
or O
obstructive O
sleep O
apnea O

we O
will O
have O
him O
see O
a O
pulmonologist O
and O
treat O
these O
accordingly O


I O
will O
see O
him O
again O
in O
six O
months O

time O




Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
participate O
in O
the O

of O
this O

current O

precedence O






Pt O
presents O
very O
discouraged O
over O
escalating O
Lasix O
doses O
and O
persistant O
problems O
with O
reccurent O
edema O
and O
cough O

each O
time O
relieved O

so O
ACEI O
cough O
seems O
unlikely O


Avoiding O

with O
good O

Did O
see O
sleep O

tried O
new O

mask O

new O
machine O

but O
still O
tolerates O
poorly O


When O
discussed O
in O
some O
detail O

notes O
feelings O
of O
suffocation O
with O
wearing O
mask O
for O
any O
period O
of O
time O


Also O
notes O
sense O
of O
being O
tied O
down O
frrom O
mask O
very O
difficult O
to O
tolerate O


Without O
exploring O

greatly O

we O
discussed O
potential O
role O
of O
PTSD O
in O
precipitating O
symptoms O
related O
to O
mask O
use O

and O
potentially O

the O
effect O
of O
nocturnal O
hypoxia O

RV O

on O

Improving O

seems O
very O
key O

in O

and O
improving O
BGs O
are O
requiring O
reduction O

which O
is O
great O


so O
it O
seems O
that O
addressing O
OSA O
is O
the O
key O
to O
improving O
overall O
status O
now O


We O
discussed O
some O
options O


Including O
potential O
for O
tracheostomy O
to O
fix O
this O
without O
having O
to O
address O
mask O

but O
agreed O
to O
try O
to O
initiate O
trial O
of O
CBT O
to O
see O
if O
we O
can O
improve O

He O
remains O
quite O
clear O

he O
has O
no O

exploring O

the O

I O
reassured O
him O
that O

OSA O

IMPRESSION O
AND O
RECOMMENDATIONS O

DOE O
is O
likely O
multifactorial O

It O
may O
be O
beneficial O
to O
separate O
cardiac O
from O
pulmonary O
limitatio O
from O
deconditioning O
and O
I O
recommended O
a O
cardio O
pulmonary O
exercise O
test O
to O
the O
patient O

to O
which O
she O
agreed O

In O
addition O

as O
previously O
discussed O

she O
would O
benefit O
from O
pulmonary O
rehab O

Finally O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
how O
much O
asthma O
is O
contributing O
to O
the O
picture O

There O
was O
no O
response O
to O
brnonchodialtor O
today O
and O
the O
patient O
does O
not O
feel O
any O
help O
from O
it O
either O

I O
told O
her O
that O
she O
does O
not O
need O
to O
use O
albuterol O
if O
it O
doesn O
t O
help O
her O

I O
ve O
requested O
RAST O
allergy O
testing O
to O
further O
investigate O
the O
possiblity O
of O
allergic O
asthma O

We O
will O
not O
do O
the O
methacholine O
challange O
testing O
due O
to O
patient O
s O
already O
deacreased O
FEV1 O

due O
to O
restriction O

as O
it O
might O
be O
dangerous O
to O

Dear O
Matt DOCTOR



I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
Mr O

Potts PATIENT
in O
follow O
up O
today O


As O
you O
know O

he O
recently O
had O
a O
complicated O
hospital O
course O


He O
underwent O
cardiac O
catheterization O

which O
revealed O
serial O
stenoses O
of O
the O
LAD O
including O
70 O

and O
90 O

stenoses O


The O
first O
marginal O
branch O
had O
a O
60 O

ostial O
stenosis O


The O
right O
coronary O
artery O
had O
60 O
and O
80 O

stenoses O

respectively O


The O
PDA O
had O
a O
70 O

narrowing O


Given O
his O
very O
significant O
wish O
not O
to O
have O
bypass O
surgery O

it O
was O
decided O
to O
proceed O
with O
angioplasty O
of O
the O
right O
coronary O
artery O
as O
well O
as O
the O
obtuse O
marginal O


It O
was O
felt O
that O
the O
LAD O
was O
a O
small O
vessel O

and O
not O
worth O
going O
after O
at O
this O
time O


The O
RCA O
was O
successfully O
stented O

but O
was O
complicated O
by O
occlusion O
of O
the O
posterior O
left O
ventricular O
branch O


By O
the O
end O
of O
the O
procedure O

flow O
had O
been O
restored O
to O
some O
degree O
to O
the O
posterior O
left O
ventricular O
branch O

but O
Mr O

Potts PATIENT
rule O
in O
for O
a O
small O
subendocardial O
myocardial O
infarction O


Due O
to O
the O
closure O
of O
the O
left O
posterior O
ventricular O
branch O

the O
obtuse O
marginal O
branch O
was O
not O
dilated O





Mr O

Potts PATIENT
underwent O
two O
exercise O
tests O
post O

The O
second O
exercise O
test O
was O
performed O
with O
MIBI O
imaging O


He O
exercised O
for O
nine O
minutes O
on O
a O
submaximal O
Bruce O
protocol O

and O
experienced O
chest O
pain O


He O
had O
a O
maximal O
blood O
pressure O
of O
148 O
72 O
and O
a O
heart O
rate O
of O
121 O


MIBI O
images O
revealed O
a O
small O
nontransmural O
myocardial O
infarction O
of O
the O
basal O
1 O
3 O
of O
the O
inferior O
wall O


There O
was O
moderate O
to O
severe O
ischemia O
of O
the O
inferolateral O
territory O
in O
the O
territory O
of O
the O
RCA O



Given O
these O
findings O

it O
was O
highly O
recommended O
that O
Mr O

to O

have O
some O
back O
pain O
with O
radiation O
down O
her O

leg O
in O
the O
L5 O
S1 O

distribution O


She O
had O
one O
epidural O
steroid O
injection O
but O
was O
due O
to O
go O

back O


Given O
her O
upper O
respiratory O
tract O
infection O

this O
was O
postponed O





She O
is O
not O
having O
any O
heart O
symptoms O
or O
shortness O
of O

Her O
sugars O

have O
been O
under O
good O
control O

ranging O

old O
woman O
with O
multiple O
medical O

issues O

including O
coronary O

and O

She O
came O
in O
today O
for O
discussion O
of O
her O

ongoing O
lumbar O
radiculopathic O
pain O
as O
well O
as O
her O
abdominal O
complaint O



With O
regard O
to O
her O
back O
pain O

she O
wanted O
a O
prescription O
for O
Tylenol O
with O

codeine O

which O
has O
helped O
in O
the O
past O


I O
gave O
her O
a O
prescription O


I O

warned O
her O
about O
the O
possible O
side O
effects O
of O
constipation O


She O
should O

contact O
the O

clinic O
as O
soon O
as O
she O
feels O

for O
a O
repeat O
epidural O

With O

to O
her O

complaints O

the O
bubbling O
in O
her O

postprandial O
nausea O

could O

Dear O
Wanda DOCTOR


Mr O

Vance PATIENT
returns O
for O
followup O


Since O
last O
seen O

she O
apparently O
was O
recently O
seen O
in O
the O
walk O
in O
clinic O
in O
your O
office O
complaining O
of O
profound O
fatigue O
and O
depression O


She O
wonders O
if O
she O
was O
having O
a O
flare O
of O
her O
porphyria O


Apparently O

her O
examination O
at O
that O
time O
was O
relatively O
benign O

and O
no O
specific O
new O
findings O
were O
noted O


After O
talking O
with O
Dr O

Vogt DOCTOR
at O
that O
office O
visit O

she O
felt O
modestly O
improved O

and O
over O
the O
past O
few O
weeks O
feels O
that O
her O
energy O
level O
has O
returned O
to O
its O
baseline O

with O

As O
no O

she O
was O

Ms O

Vance PATIENT
remains O
relatively O
stable O
from O
a O
cardiovascular O
perspective O


However O

as O
you O
know O

her O
last O
echocardiogram O
did O
show O
evidence O
of O
at O
least O
moderate O
mitral O
regurgitation O
with O
significantly O
reduced O
left O
ventricular O
systolic O
function O


She O
has O
made O
it O
quite O
clear O
that O
under O
no O
circumstances O
would O
she O
consider O
repeat O
cardiac O
surgery O
to O
treat O
her O
valvular O
heart O
disease O


Nonetheless O

I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
helpful O
for O
her O
to O
undergo O
repeat O
echocardiogram O
to O
help O
gauge O
the O
current O
status O
of O
her O
left O
ventricle O
and O
degree O
of O
regurgitation O

which O
may O
allow O
for O
additional O
modifications O
to O
her O
therapeutic O
regimen O


Beyond O
this O

her O
condition O
is O
actually O
relatively O
stable O
from O
a O
cardiovascular O
standpoint O


I O
have O
not O
further O
altered O
her O
medical O
regimen O


Thank O
you O
very O
much O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
assist O
in O
her O
care O


Sincerely O
yours O

Dear O

Dr O

Nunes DOCTOR
and O
I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
to O
see O
your O
patient O

Mr O

Christian PATIENT
Mullen PATIENT

this O
morning O
in O
the O
office O
for O
a O
routine O
vascular O
followup O


It O
has O
been O
nearly O
18 O
months O
since O
his O
last O
visit O
here O
and O
in O
the O
interim O
time O

has O
been O
having O
discomfort O
involving O
both O
of O
his O
hips O

thighs O

and O
calves O


As O
you O
well O
know O

Mr O

Mullen PATIENT
is O
a O
delightful O
69 AGE

old O
gentleman O
with O
history O
of O
hypertension O

hyperlipidemia O

coronary O

disease O

type O
2 O
diabetes O

and O
peripheral O

who O
previously O
underwent O

left O
popliteal O

revascularization O
November DATE

followed O
by O
right O
external O

right O
internal O

and O
right O
common O
femoral O

revascularization O
in O
February DATE
2089 DATE


Despite O
the O
technical O
success O
of O
both O
procedures O

he O
continued O
to O
have O
bilateral O
hip O
claudication O
symptoms O


When O
we O
had O
last O
evaluated O
him O
in O
November DATE
2089 DATE

we O
had O
considered O
moving O
forward O
with O
CT O
angiography O
to O
assess O
the O
patency O
of O
his O
aorto O
iliac O
anatomy O


At O
the O
time O

he O
favored O
moving O
on O
a O
conservative O
course O
with O
improved O
walking O
regimen O
and O
weight O
loss O


Unfortunately O

despite O
these O
measures O

he O
feels O
quite O
disabled O
and O
limited O
by O
his O
claudication O
symptoms O


Symptoms O
are O
noticeable O
between O
20 O
and O
50 O
yards O
distance O
occurring O
in O
the O
hip O
area O
as O
well O
as O
extending O
down O
in O
to O
his O
thigh O
and O
occasionally O
the O
calves O


Symptoms O
resolve O
with O
sitting O
and O
resting O
for O
approximately O
2 O
5 O
minutes O


He O
notes O
that O
symptoms O
will O
improve O
with O
standing O
still O
however O
sitting O
symptoms O
resolve O
much O
quicker O


He O
does O
not O
necessarily O
notice O
any O
change O
with O
inclines O
or O
going O
up O
stairs O

in O
fact O

he O
is O
actually O
able O
to O
climb O
18 O
stairs O
to O
his O
office O
without O
limitation O




From O

been O

of O

Mr O

Mullen PATIENT
is O
a O

69 AGE
year O
old O
gentleman O
with O
history O
of O
coronary O

disease O

type O

peripheral O

with O
prior O

here O
for O
a O
vascular O
followup O
with O
symptoms O
of O
bilateral O
hip O

buttock O

thigh O

and O
claudication O




Mr O

Mullen PATIENT
s O
symptoms O
at O
present O
are O
suggestive O
of O
vascular O
claudication O
and O
in O
the O
sense O
that O
they O
are O
exertionally O
related O


Interestingly O

he O
has O
had O
these O
symptoms O
dating O
back O
to O
immediately O
following O
his O
revascularization O
procedures O
in O
2088 DATE
and O
2089 DATE


On O
examination O
today O

his O
femoral O
pulses O
are O
certainly O
not O
robust O
and O
may O
suggest O
the O
presence O
of O
restenosis O


We O
discussed O
with O
Mr O

Mullen PATIENT
the O
potential O
of O
going O
forward O
with O
lower O
extremity O
noninvasive O
studies O

however O

these O
revealed O
supra O
normal O
ABIs O
in O
the O
past O
secondary O
to O
his O
diabetes O


Likewise O

we O
discussed O
the O
possibility O
of O
moving O
forward O
with O
a O
non O
invasive O
imaging O
study O
i O
e O

CT O
angiogram O

however O

this O
would O
not O
provide O
the O
option O
of O
therapeutic O
intervention O
if O
indeed O
narrowings O
were O
noted O


Accordingly O

Mr O

Mullen PATIENT
is O
in O
favor O
of O
proceeding O
forward O
with O
diagnostic O
peripheral O
angiography O
plus O
minus O
therapeutic O
intervention O
if O
restenosis O
of O
his O
aortoiliac O
segments O
are O
noted O




It O
is O
indeed O
possible O
that O
there O
is O
a O
contributing O
factor O
of O
spinal O
stenosis O
in O
that O
Mr O

Mullen PATIENT
s O
symptoms O
are O
relieved O
more O
quickly O
in O
the O
sitting O
position O


Likewise O

he O
has O
noted O
improvement O
upon O
leaning O
forward O
and O
against O
a O
tree O


We O
understand O
that O
Mr O

Mullen PATIENT
is O
being O
considered O
for O
an O
upcoming O
chemical O
stress O
test O
to O
assess O
the O
patency O
for O
any O
silent O
coronary O
ischemia O


He O
is O
quite O
reticent O
to O
go O
forward O
with O
the O
chemical O
stress O
test O
though O
we O
did O
broach O
the O
subject O
of O
performing O
coronary O
catheterization O
at O
the O
time O
of O
his O
peripheral O
angiogram O
given O
that O
we O
are O
actually O
going O
to O
be O
in O
there O


He O
has O
actually O
requested O
this O
as O
opposed O
to O
going O
forward O
with O
the O
chemical O
stress O
test O


With O
your O
permission O

we O
will O
perform O
both O
coronary O
catheterization O
to O
assess O
the O
patency O
of O
his O
grafts O
in O
addition O
to O
his O
peripheral O
angiogram O
plus O
minus O
therapeutic O
intervention O
of O
his O
lower O
extremities O




Paramount O
to O
his O
ongoing O
cardiovascular O
fitness O

we O
certainly O
recommend O
blood O
pressure O
of O
130 O
80 O
or O
below O
and O
LDL O
cholesterol O
70 O
or O
below O
and O
ongoing O
exercise O
and O
weight O
loss O


We O
will O
plan O
to O
schedule O
his O
procedure O
in O
the O
upcoming O
weeks O
and O
he O
is O
to O
notify O
us O
if O

are O
progressed O

Dear O
Dr O

Cooper DOCTOR




I O
had O
the O
pleasure O
of O
seeing O
your O
patient O

Christian PATIENT
Mullen PATIENT
today O
in O
the O
office O
in O
followup O
for O
his O
peripheral O
artery O
disease O

as O
well O
as O
his O
coronary O
disease O


I O
permanently O
follow O
him O
for O
PAD O

as O
I O
know O
he O
follows O
with O
Dr O

Fernandes DOCTOR
for O
his O
coronary O
disease O


Regarding O
his O
peripheral O
disease O

he O
is O
status O
post O
left O
common O
femoral O
endarterectomy O

performed O
at O
my O
request O
by O
Dr O

Fredrick DOCTOR
Xa DOCTOR
couple O
of O
years O
ago O


This O
alleviated O
some O
of O
his O
left O
leg O
claudication O

though O
he O
still O
has O
some O
residual O
symptoms O
in O
that O
left O
calf O


The O
right O
calf O
is O
what O
bothers O
him O
more O

with O
symptoms O
that O
are O
earlier O
in O
onset O


They O
occurred O
about O
100 O
yards O
of O
walking O
on O
the O
flat O


While O
Chris PATIENT
is O
affected O
by O
this O

it O
does O
not O
preclude O
him O
from O
doing O
his O
usual O
activities O
of O
daily O
living O


He O
also O
continues O
to O
travel O

on O
his O
way O
to O
Bogalusa CITY
with O
Brad PATIENT
Fair PATIENT

his O
partner O

next O
week O


and O
also O
continues O
to O
work O
actively O


The O
biggest O
problem O
with O
his O
claudication O
is O
that O
it O
prevents O
him O
from O
being O
physically O
active O
enough O
to O
lose O
enough O
weight O


As O
he O
says O

he O
put O
on O
about O
80 O
pounds O
after O
his O
coronary O
bypass O
graft O
in O
2082 DATE

and O
he O
has O
had O
trouble O
losing O
the O
weight O

He O
is O
considering O
weight O
reduction O
surgery O

but O
has O
not O
made O
a O
decision O
about O
this O
yet O


He O
is O
struggling O
with O
the O
decision O


I O
would O
support O
him O
either O
way O
in O
this O
regard O

encouraging O
him O
to O
lose O
weight O
however O
he O
can O
do O
so O


In O
terms O
of O
his O
lower O
extremities O

his O
exam O
demonstrates O
diminished O
pulses O

absent O
to O
palpation O

in O
both O
ankles O

but O
they O
are O
audible O
by O
Doppler O


Both O
feet O
are O
well O
perfused O

with O
good O
capillary O
refill O


He O
has O
no O
ulcers O
or O
gangrene O


From O
a O
cardiac O
standpoint O

Chris PATIENT
is O
doing O
well O


He O
denies O
significant O
dyspnea O
or O
chest O
discomfort O

although O
he O
is O
limited O
in O
terms O
of O
walking O
because O
of O
his O
legs O


It O
has O
been O
11 O
years O
since O
his O
bypass O
operation O

and O
I O
think O
it O
would O
be O
reasonable O
to O
do O
a O
stress O
test O
on O
him O
to O
make O
certain O
that O
there O
is O
no O
evidence O
of O
silent O
ischemia O


While O
this O
might O
be O
controversial O

as O
to O
whether O
to O
do O
a O
stress O
test O
or O
not O

my O
own O
gut O
feeling O
is O
that O
it O
is O
probably O
the O
right O
time O
in O
this O
patient O
with O
significant O
risk O
factors O
and O
limitations O
on O
the O
basis O
of O
his O
lower O
extremity O
disease O


He O
requests O
specifically O
we O
do O
this O
study O
here O

so O
I O
will O
take O
the O
liberty O
of O
ordering O
an O
adenosine O
MIBI O

and O
certainly O
will O
forward O
you O
the O
results O


Otherwise O

Chris PATIENT
is O
doing O
great O


We O
will O
continue O
to O
work O
on O
risk O
factor O
modification O
and O
I O
will O
see O
him O
again O
in O
six O
months O


We O
will O
also O
order O
an O
exercise O
ABI O
and O
duplex O
of O
his O
lower O
extremities O
to O
assess O
where O
we O
stand O
at O
the O
present O
time O


If O
his O
symptoms O
progress O
to O
the O
point O
where O
they O
are O
more O
disabling O

then O
we O
would O
consider O
further O
evaluation O


Otherwise O

as O
long O
as O
his O
symptoms O
remain O
stable O
and O
his O
lifestyle O
is O
not O
terribly O
limited O

we O
will O
continue O
the O
same O

If O

Assessment O

I O
agree O
he O
clearly O
needs O
a O
coronary O
angiogram O
as O
well O
as O
a O
left O
ventricular O
angiogram O
to O
assess O
MR O


He O
should O
also O
have O
a O
left O
right O
heart O
catheter O
because O
of O
the O
aortic O
ejection O
murmur O


In O
the O
meantime O
I O
will O
ask O
into O
double O
his O
isosorbide O
to O
40 O
mg O
in O
the O
morning O
and O
again O
at O
3 O
p O
m O

to O
give O
him O
better O
protection O
throughout O
the O
day O


I O
will O
ask O
him O
to O
increase O
his O
aspirin O
to O
325 O
mg O
a O
day O


I O
will O
also O
add O
fish O
oil O
1000 O
mg O
a O
day O
which O
is O
been O
shown O
to O
reduce O
the O
risk O
of O
sudden O
death O


Finally O
we O
will O
double O
his O
Zocor O
to O
40 O
mg O
to O
try O
to O
reach O
the O
new O
goal O
of O
an O
LDL O
of O
less O
than O
70 O


I O
explained O
the O
rationale O
for O
proceeding O
on O
with O
the O
catheterization O
and O
the O
probability O
that O
we O
will O
find O
multivessel O
disease O
that O
will O
not O
be O
suitable O
for O
PCI O
but O
rather O
for O
continued O
medicine O
or O
possible O
surgery O


Of O
course O
the O
catheterization O
will O
determine O
that O


He O
should O
not O
consider O
any O
total O
knee O
operation O
until O
the O
cardiac O
status O
is O
clarified O

who O

with O

of O

etiology O


The O
differential O
diagnosis O
is O
broad O
and O
includes O
both O
infectious O
and O
non O
infectious O
diagnoses O


Our O
leading O
diagnosis O
is O
either O
radiation O
fibrosis O
or O
a O
primary O
interstitial O
lung O
disease O

such O
as O
COP O


However O

we O
also O
think O
that O
several O

etiologies O
should O
be O
considered O


Endemic O
mycoses O

histo O

blasto O
and O
crypto O


cryptococcal O

nocardiasis O

aspergillus O

mucormycosis O
and O
MAC O
are O
some O
diseases O
to O
consider O
in O
this O
patient O


While O
the O
clinical O
picture O
of O
granulomas O
on O
chest O
CT O
and O
cough O
is O
consistent O
with O
the O
diagnosis O
of O
mycobacterial O
disease O

the O
patient O
is O
very O

risk O
for O
this O
infection O
and O
his O
lack O
of O
fevers O

progressive O
weight O

argues O
against O
this O

My O
highest O
suspicion O

an O

Dear O
Dr O

Trujillo DOCTOR





Thank O
you O
for O
referring O
Mrs O

Shirley PATIENT
Trent PATIENT

a O
68 AGE
year O
old O
lady O

with O
peripheral O
artery O
disease O

on O
whom O
you O
plan O
to O
do O

revascularization O
of O
the O
right O
leg O


Her O
history O
is O
well O
known O
to O

you O
but O
I O
will O
repeat O
it O
for O
our O
records O


She O
has O
a O
long O
history O

of O
cigarette O
smoking O
with O
a O
3 O
packet O
per O
day O
history O
for O
30 O

years O

stopping O
15 O
years O
ago O


She O
has O
developed O
claudication O


particularly O
in O
the O
right O
leg O

over O
the O
last O
year O
since O
her O

husband O
died O

which O
has O
all O
the O
typical O
symptoms O
and O
is O
relieved O

by O
rest O


This O
seems O
predominantly O
in O
the O
right O
calf O
but O
is O
also O

in O
the O
right O
thigh O
as O
well O


She O
had O
segmental O
leg O
pressures O
done O

which O
shows O
some O
mild O
diminution O
in O
the O
left O
leg O
but O
an O

ankle O
brachial O
index O
of O
0 O
65 O
in O
the O
right O
leg O


An O
MR O
angiogram O

showed O
stenosis O

although O
I O
do O
not O
have O
the O
full O
report O
on O
this O

as O
yet O





She O
has O
intercurrent O
problems O
with O
insulin O
dependent O
diabetes O

mellitus O

which O
she O
has O
had O
for O
10 O
years O


Her O
other O
cardiac O
risk O

factors O
apart O
from O
cigarette O
smoking O
include O
a O
family O
history O
of O

myocardial O
infarction O
in O
her O
father O

and O
it O
is O
uncertain O
what O
her O

cholesterol O
level O
is O


She O
has O
no O
history O
of O
hypertension O


although O
I O
am O
uncertain O
whether O
this O
has O
been O
checked O
in O
the O

past O


She O
has O
a O
past O
history O
of O
partial O
gastrectomy O
in O
2059 DATE
for O

a O
bleeding O
peptic O
ulcer O
and O
this O
has O
led O
to O
some O
difficulty O
in O

swallowing O
tablets O
and O
keeping O
them O
down O


She O
also O
has O
a O
past O

history O
of O
a O
right O
middle O
lobectomy O
in O
2079 DATE
for O
adenocarcinoma O

that O
had O
clear O
margins O
and O
did O
not O
require O
further O
adjunctive O

therapy O


She O
also O
had O
a O
cholecystectomy O
in O
2079 DATE

which O
was O

uneventful O





Systems O

no O

and O
all O

are O
negative O





She O
lives O
alone O

and O
her O
current O
medications O
include O
insulin O

only O


She O
has O
no O
allergies O





On O
physical O
examination O

she O
is O
alert O
and O
orientated O
without O
any O

signs O
of O
jaundice O

clubbing O

or O
cyanosis O


Her O
heart O
rate O
was O
85 O

beats O
per O
minute O
with O
a O
blood O
pressure O
of O
160 O
85 O
in O
both O
arms O



The O
jugular O
venous O
pressure O
was O
not O
elevated O

and O
her O
carotid O

upstrokes O
were O
reduced O

but O
she O
had O
no O
bruits O
audible O


Her O
apex O

beat O
was O
not O
palpable O

and O
she O
had O
a O
normal O
first O
and O
second O

heart O
sound O
without O
added O
sounds O

murmurs O

or O
gallops O


Her O
chest O

was O
clear O
to O
percussion O
and O
auscultation O


She O
had O
no O

hepatosplenomegaly O
and O
no O
abdominal O
masses O
or O
pulsations O


She O

had O
the O
scars O
from O
previous O
operations O
present O


Her O
femoral O

pulses O
were O
absent O
on O
the O
right O
side O
and O
reduced O
on O
the O
left O
side O

without O
bruits O


She O
had O
reduced O
but O
palpable O
dorsalis O
pedis O
and O

posterior O
tibial O
pulses O
on O
the O
left O
leg O
but O
no O
pedal O
pulses O
on O

the O
right O
leg O


There O
were O
no O
trophic O
changes O
in O
her O
legs O


She O

had O
reduced O
sensation O
to O
pinprick O
in O
both O
feet O
to O
the O
mid O
calf O

level O
in O
a O
stocking O
distribution O





Her O
ECG O
showed O
sinus O
rhythm O
without O
abnormalities O





Assessment O


This O
lady O
obviously O
has O
severe O
claudication O
and O

requires O
revascularization O

but O
is O
uncertain O
whether O
she O
has O
any O

myocardial O
ischemia O


I O
therefore O
think O
a O
stress O
test O
is O

required O


She O
also O
has O
difficulty O
in O
swallowing O
medications O
and O

this O
will O
prove O
a O
problem O
for O
the O
long O
term O
management O
of O
her O

atherosclerosis O

which O
I O
would O
like O
to O
further O
evaluate O





Plan O


I O
therefore O
organized O
a O
dobutamine O
stress O
test O
to O
assess O

for O
myocardial O
ischemia O
and O
cardiovascular O
risk O


I O
have O
also O

asked O
her O
to O
start O
on O
a O
small O
dose O
of O
a O
beta O
blocker O
for O
reducing O

her O
perioperative O
risk O
as O
well O
as O
treating O
her O
blood O
pressure O


which O
is O
elevated O


I O
have O
also O
asked O
her O
to O
have O
a O
fasting O
blood O

lipid O
test O
today O
so O
we O
can O
assess O
her O
cholesterol O
level O

as O
it O
is O

likely O
that O
she O
would O
benefit O
from O
lipid O
lowering O
therapy O


I O

plan O
to O
evaluate O
all O
these O
in O
approximately O
a O
month O
or O
so O
after O

her O
operation O
so O
that O
we O
can O
manage O
her O
in O
the O
long O
term O





I O
will O
let O
you O
know O
the O
results O
of O
her O
stress O
test O
when O
they O

become O
available O


Thank O
you O
for O
allowing O
me O
to O
take O
part O
in O
this O

lady O
s O
care O





Yours O
sincerely O

is O
a O
lovely O
52 AGE
year O
old O
female O
in O

you O
have O
found O
a O
left O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
surgery O


She O
comes O
in O
today O
for O
perioperative O
risk O
assessment O


Ms O

Hendricks PATIENT
tells O
me O
that O
she O
has O
longstanding O
type O
1 O
diabetes O

hypertension O

hyperlipidemia O

and O
peripheral O
arterial O
disease O


She O
in O
fact O
has O
undergone O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
grafting O
in O
both O
her O
left O
and O
right O
lower O
extremities O


Specifically O

she O
is O
status O
post O
a O

fem O
pop O
bypass O
in O
2066 DATE
and O
a O
left O
fem O
DP O
bypass O
also O
in O
2066 DATE


It O
appears O
that O
her O
right O
graft O
has O
been O
functioning O
well O

but O
her O
left O
graft O
was O
noted O
to O
be O
occluded O
many O
years O
ago O


She O
comes O
in O
now O
with O
a O
nonhealing O
ulcer O
and O
gangrene O
in O
her O
left O
toe O


You O
have O
planned O
a O
redo O
bypass O
for O
this O
upcoming O
Saturday DATE



Ms O

Hendricks PATIENT
tells O
me O
that O
she O
has O
never O
had O
any O
history O
of O

never O
had O
any O

48 AGE
of O
an O
MI O


She O
has O
a O
report O
of O
a O
prior O

never O
had O
any O
evaluation O
for O
underlying O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
nor O
has O
she O
had O
any O
symptoms O
referable O
to O

In O
terms O
of O
her O
functional O
capacity O

she O
tells O
me O
that O
up O
until O
a O
year O
ago O

she O
was O
doing O
spinning O
classes O
without O
any O
chest O
discomfort O
or O
shortness O
of O
breath O
whatsoever O


Because O
of O
increasing O
discomfort O
in O
her O
left O
lower O
extremity O

she O
had O
to O
reduce O
her O
exercise O
and O
of O
late O
has O
only O
been O
able O
to O
do O
weightlifting O
without O
aerobic O

She O
works O
as O
a O
Senior PROFESSION

in O
Albemarle CITY



As O
I O
mentioned O
previously O

her O
family O
history O
is O
notable O
for O
a O
brother O
who O
died O
of O
an O
MI O
in O
his O
late O
40s AGE



On O
physical O

In O

Her O

benign O


She O
has O
no O
abdominal O
bruits O
and O
no O
significantly O
palpable O
aorta O


Her O
lower O
extremity O
exam O
is O
notable O
for O
a O
hyperemic O
left O
foot O
with O
a O
bandage O

which O
is O
covering O
what O
is O
reportedly O
a O
gangrenous O

Her O
left O

pulses O
are O

in O
the O

An O
EKG O
done O
in O
our O
clinic O
today O
demonstrates O
a O
normal O
sinus O
rhythm O
at O
a O
rate O
of O
97 O
beats O
per O

with O
a O
left O

There O
is O
left O
atrial O

and O
Q O
waves O
in O
V1 O
through O

suggestive O
of O
an O
old O
anteroseptal O
MI O


There O
are O
also O
Q O
waves O
in O

III O
and O
aVF O

which O
raises O
suspicion O
of O
an O
old O
inferior O
MI O



In O
summary O

Ms O

Hendricks PATIENT
is O
a O
lovely O
52 AGE
year O
old O
female O
with O
longstanding O
diabetes O

hypertension O

hyperlipidemia O

and O
peripheral O
arterial O
disease O
who O
comes O
in O
today O
for O
perioperative O
risk O
assessment O
in O
light O
of O
an O
anticipated O
redo O
left O
lower O
extremity O
bypass O
graft O


She O
appears O
to O
have O
an O
excellent O
functional O
capacity O
up O
until O
several O
months O
ago O


However O

I O
am O
concerned O
by O
her O
electrocardiogram O

which O
raises O
the O
suspicion O
of O
underlying O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
given O
the O
findings O
of O
a O
probable O
inferior O
and O
old O
anteroseptal O
myocardial O
infarction O


As O
such O

I O
think O
that O
it O
would O
be O
wise O
to O
better O
delineate O
her O
burden O
of O
coronary O
artery O
disease O
by O
way O
of O
a O
stress O
test O
prior O
to O
her O
surgery O


Given O
that O
her O
functional O
status O
has O
been O
so O
good O
up O
until O
recently O

I O
do O
not O
think O
that O
we O
need O
to O
delay O
her O
surgery O


However O

I O
would O
start O
her O
on O
a O
beta O
blocker O
and O
as O
such O

I O
have O
given O
her O
a O
prescription O
for O
atenolol O
25 O
mg O
once O
daily O

which O
she O
will O
start O
today O
and O
continue O
up O
to O
and O
beyond O
the O
perioperative O
period O



During O
the O
perioperative O
period O

we O
would O
recommend O
that O
she O
has O
tight O
control O
of O
her O
blood O
pressure O
and O
heart O
rate O
with O
a O
goal O
blood O
pressure O
less O
than O
120 O
80 O
and O
a O
goal O
heart O
rate O
less O
than O
60 O


I O
would O
also O
make O
sure O
to O
obtain O
a O
postoperative O
EKG O
to O
ensure O
there O
has O
not O
been O
any O
changes O



We O
will O
try O
to O
arrange O
for O
an O
exercise O
test O
with O
arm O
ergometry O
and O
MIBI O
imaging O
for O
tomorrow O
morning O


If O
we O
are O
unable O
to O
do O
arm O
exercise O

we O
will O
obtain O
an O
adenosine O
MIBI O


I O
will O
follow O
up O
with O
the O
results O
tomorrow O
after O
the O
study O
is O
performed O


As O
I O
mentioned O
because O
her O
functional O
capacity O
is O
good O

I O
do O
not O
anticipate O
that O
we O
will O
need O
to O
make O
any O
changes O
in O
the O
surgical O
scheduling O
based O
on O
the O
test O
results O


This O
is O
more O
in O
order O
to O
give O
us O
a O
sense O
of O
the O
underlying O
burden O
of O
coronary O
artery O
disease O



It O
was O
a O
pleasure O
seeing O
Ms O

Hendricks PATIENT
in O
clinic O
today O


We O
are O
certainly O
available O
during O
the O
perioperative O
period O
if O
any O
cardiovascular O
issues O
are O
to O
arise O


Please O
feel O
free O
to O
contact O
me O
with O
any O
questions O

As O

know O

she O
is O
a O
52 AGE

old O
woman O
with O
a O
history O
of O
peripheral O
vascular O
disease O


She O
underwent O
a O
redo O
left O
femoral O
to O

bypass O
graft O
using O
basilic O
and O

vein O
from O
her O
right O
arm O
on O
May DATE
3 DATE

2078 DATE


She O
has O
done O
well O
since O
the O
procedure O


She O
is O
now O
comes O
here O
complaining O
of O
left O
foot O
pain O


She O
had O
an O
ultrasound O
in O
the O
vascular O
lab O
to O
rule O
out O
a O
DVT O

which O
it O
did O


She O
explains O
the O
discomfort O
as O
pain O
and O
burning O
in O
the O
bottom O
of O
her O
foot O
as O
well O
as O
her O
arch O
and O
over O
the O
dorsum O
of O
the O
foot O





On O
exam O

she O
is O
a O
well O
appearing O
female O
in O
no O
acute O
distress O


She O
is O
alert O
and O

She O
appears O
grossly O

intact O


Her O
lower O

reveals O

pulse O
in O
her O

Her O
left O

I O
cannot O

It O
remains O

She O
has O
no O
other O
ischemic O

changes O
noted O




I O
have O
discussed O
with O
Hannah PATIENT
that O
her O
discomfort O
most O
likely O
is O
due O
to O
peripheral O
neuropathy O
due O
to O
her O
diabetes O


She O
also O
experienced O
this O
discomfort O
prior O
to O
her O
surgery O


She O
is O
enquiring O
about O
starting O
Neurontin O


I O
have O
said O
she O
would O
be O
able O
to O
try O
either O
Neurontin O
or O
Lyrica O
to O
help O
with O
the O
peripheral O
neuropathy O


She O
will O
return O
next O
week O
for O
her O
postoperative O
graft O
scan O
to O
assess O
her O
circulation O


She O
knows O
to O
contact O
us O
sooner O
if O
thing O
worsen O




If O
I O

I O
was O
concerned O

we O
gave O

The O

does O
not O
extend O

would O
be O

extremely O

also O

She O
is O
obviously O
older O

but O
she O
had O
previous O
lymphadenopathy O
that O
may O
have O
been O
a O
first O
presentation O

the O
illness O
with O

The O

findings O

systemic O
symptoms O

hypercalcemia O

abnormal O
serum O

are O
all O
suggestive O
of O
this O
diagnosis O




Her O
hypercalcemia O
is O
symptomatic O
and O
should O
be O
treated O
with O
volume O
repletion O


She O
should O
not O
receive O
diuretics O
at O
present O


Long O
term O
treatment O
will O
be O
dependent O
on O
the O
underlying O
diagnosis O
and O
its O
treatment O


I O
think O
she O
will O
need O
corticosteroids O
for O
her O
sarcoidosis O
and O
I O
expect O
this O
will O
improve O
the O
hypercalcemia O

but O
we O
need O
definitive O
diagnosis O
first O




The O
cardiac O
murmur O
is O
impressive O

but O
likely O
unrelated O
to O
the O
pulmonary O
disease O


We O
need O
echocardiogram O
to O
better O
define O
valvular O
function O


The O
minimally O
elevated O
troponins O
are O
not O
felt O

be O
of O
clinical O
significance O
at O
this O
point O

she O

the O

EMERGENCY O
DEPARTMENT O
COURSE O


My O
chief O
concern O
for O
this O
patient O

is O
her O
inability O
to O
care O
for O
self O
at O
home O


It O
is O
apparent O
that O

her O
son O
is O
interested O
in O
helping O
her O
and O
do O
so O

but O
the O
patient O

on O
physical O
exam O
has O
some O
obvious O
lack O
of O
hygiene O
and O
I O
am O

concerned O
that O
potentially O
the O
patient O
has O
either O
an O
underlying O

neurologic O
or O
psychiatric O
issue O
that O
is O
preventing O
her O
from O

thriving O
at O
home O


Psychiatry O
initially O
was O
consulted O


Their O

impression O
was O
that O
the O
patient O
may O
have O
neuro O
behavior O
problem O

that O
needs O
further O
outpatient O
workup O

and O
she O
was O
referred O
to O
a O

specific O
providers O
within O
the O
next O
2 O
weeks O


The O
patient O
was O

treated O
with O
potassium O
chloride O
for O
her O
hypokalemia O


Care O

coordinator O
and O
social O
services O
were O
consulted O


The O
patient O
will O

have O
a O
home O
safety O
evaluation O
and O
will O
be O
referred O
for O
primary O

care O
services O

was O
discharged O
with O
a O

for O

and O

will O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN O


1 O

Weight O
loss O


Probably O
due O
to O
poor O
caloric O
intake O


This O
is O
a O
significant O
health O
concern O
for O
her O

as O
she O
has O
become O
progressively O
cachectic O
and O
weak O


This O
is O
probably O
attributed O
to O

by O
some O
extent O

her O
progressive O
dysphagia O


She O
is O
referred O
urgently O
to O
Nutrition O

and O
will O
see O
them O
on O
Tuesday DATE


I O
suggested O
to O
the O
daughter O
and O
to O
the O
nutritionist O
that O
we O
transition O
her O
to O
tube O
feeds O
for O
at O
least O
a O
couple O
of O
weeks O

to O
get O
her O
muscle O
mass O
up O

and O
then O
reevaluate O


She O
should O
continue O
to O
take O
p O
o O

foods O
as O
tolerated O

but O
she O
needs O
to O
attempt O
to O
meet O
her O
caloric O
intake O
via O
the O
G O
tube O

since O
she O
is O
clearly O
not O
meeting O
it O
p O
o O


Will O
try O
Glucerna O
because O
of O
her O
diabetes O
history O


The O
patient O
s O
daughter O
and O
the O
nutritionist O
are O
aware O
of O
her O
issues O
with O
vitamin O
K O
and O

and O
they O
will O
discuss O
this O
further O
when O

I O
need O
to O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN O

with O

no O

Fortunately O
she O

not O

I O
am O
not O
sure O
why O
her O

whether O
this O
is O
related O
to O
the O
stress O
of O
the O

verses O

Given O
that O
the O

persisted O

I O
will O
add O

discuss O

I O
will O
recheck O
this O
in O
a O
week O
or O
two O
after O
we O
treat O
her O
hypertension O


We O
spent O
over O
half O
of O
today O
s O
45 O
minute O
visit O
discussing O
risks O
and O
benefits O
of O
Coumadin O
therapy O


Although O
she O
is O
at O
risk O
for O
falls O

she O
feels O
quite O
clearly O
that O
she O
prefers O
to O
be O
on O
the O
Coumadin O
due O
to O
her O
fear O
of O
having O
a O
repeated O
thrombotic O
stroke O


She O
feels O
that O
she O
has O
not O
had O
any O
bleeding O
complications O

and O
that O
she O
really O
would O
not O
like O
to O
suffer O
through O
another O
stroke O


I O
explained O
that O
there O
was O
some O
risk O
with O
falls O
of O
intracranial O
hemorrhage O
and O
its O
consequences O


I O
spoke O
with O
Dr O

Dewitt DOCTOR
last O
month O
about O
her O
Coumadin O

and O
we O
both O
feel O
that O
it O
seems O
to O
be O
working O
well O
in O
terms O
of O
stroke O
prevention O

but O
that O
she O
is O
at O
increased O
risk O
for O
falls O


It O
seems O
to O
me O
that O
she O
is O
in O
a O
gray O
area O
with O
no O
clear O
right O
answer O
in O
terms O
of O
risk O
benefit O
analysis O
for O
Coumadin O
for O
her O


She O
feels O
very O
strongly O
that O
she O
wishes O
to O
continue O


This O
was O
discussed O
in O
detail O
with O
her O
and O
her O
daughter O

and O
this O
probably O
is O
a O
reasonable O
decision O


I O
encouraged O
her O
to O
restart O
physical O
therapy O
to O
work O
on O
her O
strength O
and O
hopefully O
diminish O
her O
risk O
of O
a O
subsequent O
fall O

Betty PATIENT
is O
a O
78 AGE
year O
old O
woman O
with O

Her O
most O

but O
there O
is O
no O
hint O
now O
of O

My O
continued O
feeling O
is O
that O
we O
ought O
to O
focus O
on O
her O
controllable O
risk O
factors O

such O
as O
diabetes O

hypertension O

hyperlipidemia O

as O
you O
are O
doing O


I O
understand O
you O
have O
recently O
been O
adjusting O

antihypertensive O
regimen O


I O
would O
recommend O
a O
goal O
systolic O
blood O
pressure O
no O
lower O
than O
120 O
mmHg O




I O
think O
a O
reasonable O
way O

this O
is O
to O
use O

her O
clinical O
status O

and O

2 O


functional O

imaging O

such O
as O
Diamox O

to O
follow O
her O

I O
think O
intervention O
would O
be O
warranted O
if O
there O
were O
a O
deterioration O
in O
one O
of O
these O
parameters O

not O

I O
did O
review O

Our O
impression O
is O
that O

while O
the O
wording O
of O
the O
reports O
seems O
to O
suggest O
significant O
progression O
of O
the O
LICA O
stenosis O

it O
s O
not O
significant O
enough O
to O
prompt O
us O
to O
act O

in O
the O
absence O
of O

or O

changes O




I O

This O
61 AGE
year O
old O
ambidextrous O
female O
is O
referred O
by O
Dr O

Orellana DOCTOR
for O
followup O
of O
possible O
stroke O
or O
TIA O


The O
patient O
is O
interviewed O
and O
available O
records O
are O
reviewed O


In O
February DATE

she O
developed O
left O
leg O
weakness O
on O
arising O
one O
morning O


There O
was O
also O
some O
possible O
ataxia O
of O
the O
left O
upper O
extremity O
with O
decreased O
control O
of O
both O
the O
arm O
and O
the O
leg O


This O
seemed O
to O
occur O
for O
two O
days O
in O
a O
row O
and O
on O
one O
occasion O

she O
fell O
getting O
out O
of O
bed O


The O
symptoms O
resolved O
before O
she O
could O
be O
evaluated O


She O
attributed O
the O
symptoms O
to O
not O
enough O
air O
pressure O
in O
her O
air O
mattress O
and O
once O
this O
was O
corrected O

she O
feels O
that O
the O
event O
has O
not O
re O
occured O


The O
second O
event O
was O
apparently O
associated O
with O
some O
left O
facial O
weakness O
as O
well O


She O
was O
seen O
by O
Neurology O
on O
02 DATE
10 DATE
43 DATE
after O
she O
was O
admitted O


The O
history O
includes O
also O
lightheadedness O
and O
foggy O
vision O
per O
that O
report O


Initially O
MRI O
of O
the O
head O
showed O
no O
acute O
events O
but O
did O
show O
a O
change O
in O
the O
right O
posterior O
cerebral O
artery O
and O
a O
lesion O
in O
the O
left O
temporal O
lobe O


Also O

in O
the O
record O
is O
noted O
that O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
second O
event O

her O
glucose O
was O
very O
low O
at O
around O
32 O
and O
symptoms O
resolved O
after O
treatment O
with O
D50 O


There O
was O
also O
further O
history O
that O
the O
patient O
had O
been O
seeing O
a O
chiropractor O
for O
treatment O
of O
neck O
pain O
in O
the O
several O
months O
leading O
up O
to O
the O
event O


On O
examination O
at O
the O
time O
of O
admission O

there O
were O
no O
clear O
findings O


MRI O
was O
said O
to O
show O
periventricular O
white O
matter O
changes O


The O
area O
of O
abnormality O
adjacent O
to O
the O
left O
lateral O
ventricle O
was O
thought O
to O
perhaps O
represent O
an O
old O
prior O
small O
hemorrhage O


MRA O
of O
the O
brain O
showed O
absence O
of O
visualization O
of O
the O
right O

about O
1 O
cm O
beyond O
its O
origin O
but O
MRA O
of O
the O
neck O
showed O
no O
significant O
changes O


Subsequent O
echocardiogram O
showed O
mild O
LVH O
with O
no O
evidence O
of O
a O
shunt O


Currently O

the O
patient O
is O
asymptomatic O
and O
presents O
for O
routine O
followup O


It O
has O
been O
unclear O
what O
the O
cause O
of O
her O
symptoms O
was O


Some O
have O
attributed O
the O
symptoms O
to O
hypoglycemia O
and O
another O
formulation O
was O
that O
of O
a O
thalamic O
TIA O
given O
the O
changes O
in O
the O
right O
PCA O
on O
MRA O


Another O
consideration O
was O
dissection O
from O
manipulation O
by O
the O
chiropractor O


There O
is O
no O
clinical O
history O
to O
go O
with O
the O
possible O

Comment O


I O
would O
agree O
with O
prior O
examiners O
that O
the O
symptoms O
probably O
do O
not O
relate O
to O
the O
position O
of O
the O
bed O
or O
air O
in O
the O
air O
mattress O


I O
do O
not O
think O
the O
symptoms O
are O
approximate O
enough O
to O
the O
chiropractic O
manipulation O
to O
be O
relevant O


Symptoms O
could O
have O
related O
to O
hypoglycemia O
or O
could O
have O
been O
vascular O
in O
nature O


In O
this O
regard O

the O
PCA O
stenosis O
or O
occlusion O
may O
be O
relevant O


It O
is O
not O
immediately O
clear O
how O
to O
fit O
in O
the O
old O
hemorrhage O


PLAN O


Although O

she O
should O
be O
on O
some O
type O
of O
antiplatelet O
agent O


She O
was O
on O
aspirin O
at O
the O
time O
of O
the O
event O
and O
therefore O
would O
be O
considered O
an O
aspirin O
failure O


We O
therefore O
suggested O
Plavix O
75 O
mg O
daily O


We O
were O
subsequently O
called O
by O
the O
pharmacy O
and O
informed O
that O
she O
is O
already O
on O
Aggrenox O


It O
probably O
does O
not O
matter O
which O
medication O
she O
chooses O

however O

she O
should O
be O
on O
one O
or O
the O
other O
and O
not O
both O


For O
treatment O
of O
the O
homocysteine O
level O
elevation O

we O
have O
added O
simply O
multivitamins O
two O
daily O


I O
am O
not O
sure O
how O
significant O
this O
finding O
is O
in O
relation O
to O
the O
above O
symptoms O


She O
is O
advised O
to O
watch O
her O
glucose O
level O
and O
adjust O
medicines O
accordingly O


We O
have O
suggested O
a O
followup O
in O
Neurology O
in O
six O
months O

and O
also O
his O

and O

His O
referring O

Dr O


Ximena DOCTOR

practicing O

of O
Alexandria HOSPITAL

Mr O


Olive PATIENT
also O
heard O
about O
the O

through O

He O
is O
73 AGE
years O
old O

has O
history O
of O
diabetes O
starting O
in O
2135 DATE

known O
history O
of O
peripheral O
artery O
disease O
with O
claudication O
and O
calf O
discomfort O

for O
which O
he O
has O
previously O
seen O
Dr O


Cain DOCTOR
at O
Alexandria HOSPITAL
Clinic HOSPITAL

and O
also O
has O
been O
evaluated O
and O
treated O
at O
the O
Corcoran HOSPITAL
District HOSPITAL
Hospital HOSPITAL


Specifically O

he O
describes O
having O
been O
evaluated O
by O
Dr O


Cain DOCTOR
and O
others O
some O
three O
or O
four O
years O
ago O

and O
undergoing O
at O
least O
two O
procedures O

all O
related O
to O
his O
legs O
cramping O
up O


He O
received O
prior O
stenting O
to O
his O
right O
common O
iliac O
artery O
and O
his O
left O
superficial O
femoral O
artery O

so O
far O
as O
I O
can O
tell O


The O
stents O
were O
placed O
at O
Pomeroy HOSPITAL
Care HOSPITAL
Center HOSPITAL

Big CITY
Rapids CITY

AC HOSPITAL

and O
also O
he O
had O
evaluation O
at O
the O
Corcoran HOSPITAL
District HOSPITAL
Hospital HOSPITAL

and O
may O
have O
had O
a O
stenting O
procedure O
or O
revascularization O
procedure O
there O


The O
patient O
and O
his O
wife O
are O
somewhat O
unclear O
about O
the O
dates O
and O
locations O
and O
times O

but O
he O
does O
state O
that O
the O
treatments O
apparently O
did O
not O
help O
him O
at O
all O


Currently O

he O
has O
discomfort O
in O
both O
calves O
when O
he O
walks O
too O
far O
or O
too O
fast O

and O
this O
stops O
him O
at O
about O
50 O
yards O






The O
issue O
was O
complicated O
by O
the O
fact O
that O
he O
has O
had O
progressive O
parkinsonian O
type O
symptoms O

walking O
in O
a O
shuffle O

tipping O
forward O

and O
occasionally O
even O
falling O
forward O
and O
losing O
his O
balance O
completely O


His O
legs O
are O
rubbery O

and O
he O
does O
even O
realize O
that O
he O
is O
falling O
forward O
when O
it O
happens O


It O
is O
worse O
when O
he O
is O
carrying O
things O
that O
weigh O
anything O


At O
the O
same O
time O

his O
calves O
do O
cramp O
up O
in O
a O
typical O
fashion O
consistent O
with O
claudication O

and O
he O
has O
known O
peripheral O
artery O
disease O


Also O
feels O
though O
his O
hips O
sometimes O
are O
cramping O
up O


The O
patient O
feels O
quite O
disabled O
by O
his O
symptoms O

especially O
as O
a O
gentleman O
who O
was O
active O
and O
never O
had O
physical O
problems O
of O
this O
nature O


Again O

there O
is O
some O
degree O
of O
blurring O
between O
the O
parkinsonian O
symptoms O
and O
his O
claudication O

as O
to O
which O
is O
truly O
causing O
his O
disability O

Lower O
extremity O
arterial O
disease O

PAD O

the O
patient O
clearly O
has O
history O
of O
PAD O
with O
prior O
interventions O
on O
both O
sides O


Currently O

complains O
of O
symptoms O
that O
sound O
like O
claudication O

predominantly O
involving O
the O
calves O
on O
both O
sides O

right O
slightly O
ahead O
of O
the O
left O

and O
I O
would O
not O
be O
surprised O
if O
he O
has O
significant O
focal O
obstructive O
disease O
along O
the O
length O
of O
his O
iliac O
of O
SFA O


Since O
his O
ABIs O
are O
well O
preserved O
at O
rest O

I O
suspect O
he O
does O
not O
have O
pre O
occlusion O
of O
the O
SFA O

for O
example O


On O
the O
other O
hand O

he O
does O
have O
diabetes O
and O
his O
ABIs O
may O
be O
falsely O
elevated O






His O
major O
limitation O
is O
due O
to O
a O
combination O
of O
the O
claudication O
that O
occurs O
less O
than O
50 O
yards O
and O
stops O
him O
at O
that O
point O

and O
the O
gait O
disturbance O
that O
he O
has O
related O
to O
his O
movement O
disorder O

possible O
Parkinson O
s O
disease O


I O
am O
not O
sure O
that O
this O
latter O
entity O
has O
been O
well O
enough O
defined O

and O
I O
would O
suggest O
that O
we O
have O
him O
see O
a O
neurologist O
here O
to O
better O
ascertain O
the O
nature O
of O
that O
disease O

and O
as O
to O
whether O
there O
is O
anything O
better O
available O
in O
the O
way O
of O
treatment O

This O

of O

a O
very O

really O

However O
I O
am O

absolutely O
ruling O

I O
would O
suggest O
the O

Her O

factor O
control O
is O
decent O
and O
she O
should O
certainly O
stay O
on O
the O
Lipitor O

Plavix O


Since O
her O
problem O
is O
claudication O
I O
would O
like O
Yair DOCTOR
to O
institute O
Pletal O
at O
full O
dosages O
and O
give O
this O
at O

a O
couple O
of O

before O
we O
can O
say O
that O
she O
has O
had O
an O
adequate O
trial O
with O

She O
will O
get O
the O
actual O
arteriogram O
from O
the O

to O
me O


If O
it O
seems O
reasonable O
and O
the O
right O
superficial O

artery O
block O
is O
not O
too O
long O
an O

IMPRESSION O


This O
is O
a O
73 AGE
year O
old O
woman O
with O
significant O
vascular O
risk O
factors O

including O
paroxysmal O
atrial O
fibrillation O
with O
a O
left O
ICA O
MCA O
clot O
resulting O
in O
a O

MCA O
territory O
infarct O


On O
exam O

she O
has O
residual O
aphasia O
involving O
both O
comprehension O
and O
fluency O

and O
a O
moderate O
right O
hemiparesis O


It O
is O
unclear O
to O
me O
why O
the O
warfarin O
was O
discontinued O
but O
given O
her O
stroke O
and O
the O
documentation O
of O
paroxysmal O
atrial O
fibrillation O
during O
her O
hospital O
stay O

I O
think O
that O
she O
would O
benefit O
from O
anti O
coagulation O
therapy O


I O
have O
asked O
her O
to O
get O
a O
follow O
up O
PCP O
evaluation O
at O
the O
OCH HOSPITAL
to O
determine O
if O
indeed O
there O
are O
any O
contraindications O
to O
anti O
coagulation O


If O
there O
are O
no O
such O
contraindications O

she O
should O
restart O
on O
warfarin O


In O
addition O

her O
blood O
pressure O
is O
still O
not O
well O
controlled O
and O
I O
would O
ask O
her O
to O
increase O
her O
Captopril O
to O
12 O
5 O
mg O
t O
i O
d O

and O
to O
maintain O
a O

The O

Karson PATIENT
Uhrich PATIENT
is O
a O
73 AGE
year O
old O
woman O
with O
hypertension O
and O
dyslipidemia O
who O
presents O
with O
a O
three O

presyncope O
and O
weakness O
in O
the O
context O
of O
a O
new O
diagnosis O
of O
2 O
1 O
AV O
block O


Review O
of O
previous O
electrocardiograms O
reveals O
no O
right O
bundle O
branch O
block O
and O
left O
anterior O
fascicular O
block O
and O
of O
late O
this O
represents O
progression O
of O
her O
underlying O
conduction O
system O
disease O


We O
will O
proceed O
to O
permanent O
temporary O
pacemaker O
implantation O
for O
backup O
support O
and O
will O
arrange O
electrophysiologic O
consultation O
for O
permanent O
pacemaker O
implantation O


There O
is O
no O
history O
to O
suggest O
an O
ischemic O
syndrome O

so O
I O
did O
not O
think O
additional O
pharmacologic O
stress O
test O
is O
necessary O


Her O
beta O
blocker O
will O
be O
held O
overnight O
in O
addition O
to O
her O
amitriptyline O
to O
see O
if O
this O
facilitates O
recovery O
of O
her O
AV O
nodal O
function O


Overall O

I O
think O
this O
likely O
represents O
infra O
hisian O
block O
and O
a O
pacemaker O
should O
be O
curative O
therapy O


Additional O
plans O
will O
be O
dictated O
by O

With O
regards O
to O
his O
shoulder O

it O
is O
difficult O
to O
know O
whether O
his O
infection O
was O
cured O
by O
the O
4 O
week O
abx O
course O


Though O
his O
shoulder O
does O
not O
appear O
to O
be O
grossly O
infected O
on O
exam O

2 O
months O
after O
completion O
of O
his O
course O

it O
is O
too O
early O
to O
determine O
sterilization O
of O
the O
shoulder O
on O
a O
clinical O
basis O


The O
MRI O
is O
difficult O
to O
interpret O

and O
may O
well O
reflect O
prior O
inflammatory O
changes O


He O
did O
have O
persistently O
elevated O
inflammatory O
markers O

though O
confounded O
by O
multiple O
comorbidities O



Given O
the O
possibility O
that O
he O
had O
cleared O
the O
infection O

our O
plan O
as O
of O
the O
clinic O
visit O
Wednesday DATE
had O
been O
to O
observe O
him O
clinically O

off O
abx O

for O
signs O
of O
recurrent O
infection O


However O

given O
his O
fall O
and O
the O
possibility O
of O
new O
hardware O
placement O

would O
now O
favor O
a O
more O
aggressive O
workup O
of O
his O
shoulder O


As O
such O

would O
recommend O
shoulder O
aspiration O
off O
antibiotics O






The O
source O
for O
the O
L O
shoulder O
staph O
infection O
was O
never O
elucidated O

and O
blood O
cultures O
were O
negative O


However O

such O
septic O
arthritis O
often O
results O
from O
hematogenous O
seeding O

and O
there O
is O
a O
small O
change O
that O
his O
R O
hip O
may O
also O
have O
become O
infected O


This O
could O
help O
to O
explain O
the O
prosthesis O
loosening O


Alternatively O

he O
may O
have O
had O
hardware O
mechanical O
failure O
in O
setting O
of O
falls O

or O
less O
likely O
involvement O
by O

ASSESSMENT O
AND O
PLAN O


A O
76 AGE

a O
past O
history O

had O
a O
subnormal O
TSH O


She O
does O
not O
have O
obvious O
symptoms O
of O
hyperthyroidism O
but O
today O
I O
have O
obtained O
a O
repeat O
TSH O
as O
well O
as O
T3 O

T4 O


Diabetes O
continues O
to O
be O
a O
problem O


Glycemic O
control O
continues O
to O
be O
difficult O
to O
achieve O


Today O

I O
have O
reinstated O
metformin O
at O

indeed O
she O
is O
not O
taking O
this O

at O
this O

I O
plan O
close O

If O
she O
is O
hyperthyroid O

this O
may O
also O
explain O
the O
difficulty O
in O

Against O
this O
is O
the O
